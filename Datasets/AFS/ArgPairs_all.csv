4.333333333	18153	13175	17	18	3	0	3	3	If a person just raped someone (this is just an example) they shouldn't be killed for it, but something like a mass murdering or serial killing should be dealt with by putting them to death.	Yes there should be a death penalty but it should only be used in extreme circumstances like treason, mass murder, ordering murders from within prison, and killing someone in prison.
1.666666667	22346	2104	25	7	3	38	4	1	I am advocating life in prison without the option of parole.	In every state that retains the death penalty, jurors have the option of sentencing convicted capital murderers to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
2.333333333	28050	4690	121	54	3	0	1	1	You need to find lots more for the death penalty to save more lives than innocents that have been executed by it.	so you weigh whatever monetary savings (if any) over the life of someone found innocent after conviction (even if rare)?
3.666666667	3065	4690	52	107	1	0	8	1	I am not a big proponent of the death penalty.	I am very conservative and I am opposed to abortion and the death penalty.
3	4690	4690	62	42	1	9	8	1	(If a murderer is released and murders again, that has nothing to do with the death penalty, rather the sentencing laws, so doesn't contribute to the number of lives saved by the death penalty).	If it has nothing to do with the death penalty, how could it have anything to do with lives saved by the death penalty in the first place?
1.333333333	31664	15556	24	15	3	1	3	3	Some crimes are so heinous that the person who committed the crime deserves to die: I would only agree to this if the execution erased the crime that was committed in the first place.	I also don't think someone has been put to death for a third degree murder.
1.333333333	28050	2104	203	51	3	18	9	1	But if Capital punishment is used, it has to be used in all situations according to the precedent set, i.e. if the next person did not kill anyone and is wrongly convicted, he too must be executed.	The death penalty has been used as a scapegoat for many people who are against executions.
3	28050	2104	147	13	3	18	2	1	The list of men on death row who were found to be innocent and released is long and growing, and we can only guess how many innocents have been put to death.	Firstly there has been no proof that an Innocent man has ever been placed on death row.
2	8212	30812	16	114	3	4	0	3	life in jail is better than death penalty...at least they would get the chance to suffer longer...maybe that would give them a sense of what they did...or aware them of how life works.	The death penalty is gives the ability to off killers and murderers, as, if they were given life in parole, they have the ability to escape and continue their crimes.
1.333333333	1128	28050	5	30	1	0	28	3	I would prefer to live in a society where no death penalty was handed out cause there was no crime.	"I am ""for"" capital punishment... but if a criminal shows a desire for death over a life sentence, I prefer to be sadistic."
2.333333333	5572	17	36	72	1	27	2	1	I was saying, if the death penalty wasn't legit, and life imprisonment was actually the righteous thing to do, the concern of escapes shouldn't keep us from doing what's right.	I say if they try to kill/escape from life w/o parole in prison that's all we should need for the death penalty.
3	15556	4690	15	107	3	8	8	1	I am not a big proponent of the death penalty.	I'm not advocating getting rid of all punishment, just the most extreme form.
1.333333333	373	25683	22	110	1	2	0	3	I see no point in letting someone live who does not want to live, or letting someone die who does not want to die.	However, I think that the government needs to provide undeinable proof of their guilt in order to be able to sentence someone to death.
2	1676	17	22	132	1	5	2	1	I am tired of seeing people on death row for 20 or 30 years before they are put to death.	There are some who need to be put to death.
2.666666667	15556	1676	6	26	3	3	2	1	The death of a criminal prevents him from committing any further crimes.	if someone commits any crime, then they are a criminal by definition and should die.
1.333333333	30697	7933	8	250	3	23	0	1	No he the guy who killed twitter should have to suffer in jail and think about what he done for the rest of his life, and not be given the easy way out buy the death pentaly.	So what you're saying is, even if the guy we're sending to the chair didn't actually commit a murder, he should still die because he was an asshole in his personal life.
2.333333333	823	5572	34	225	1	6	1	1	Many people find some crimes heinous enough to warrent the death penalty.	The judge may or may not feel the death penaly is warranted.
4.333333333	8212	4690	4	149	3	0	2	1	Bleeding hearts will not accept the fact that the death penalty is a deterrent and saves innocent lives.	The death penalty has a foundation in justice and it spares more innocent lives.
4.333333333	25683	28050	50	123	3	1	0	3	Many, many people have already been exonerated AFTER being convicted of a capital crime.	I have evidence that says that innocent people are convicted of crimes.
1	14127	17	30	72	3	6	2	1	I was saying, if the death penalty wasn't legit, and life imprisonment was actually the righteous thing to do, the concern of escapes shouldn't keep us from doing what's right.	Because there's nothing to say that life imprisonment is a less harsh punishment.
1.333333333	4756	5572	68	97	1	18	2	1	We let killers out of prison so they can kill again.	They support it because killing murderers is the right thing to do.
3.333333333	28050	28050	203	215	3	19	2	3	Also, within the USA, murder rates are consistently lower in states that don't have capital punishment.	Louisiana, a state with the death penalty and the highest murder rate in the country, has almost no gun control.
4.333333333	30812	1676	97	22	3	16	5	1	There are some who need to be put to death.	Exactly the sort of person that we might want put to death by the justice system.
4.333333333	3271	1128	52	40	1	8	0	1	I guess the question begs to be asked to my friends on the left is If life in prisonment is so much worse then the death penalty why do you think most prisoners on death row would choose that option?	I am responding.....you seem to think thatg life in prison is worse then the death penalty........I am telling you that the prisoners on death row would disagree........
1.333333333	17	373	131	2	1	3	5	1	If we slap a guarantueed death penalty on murder then any following murderer commits the crime on pain of death which is a much better detterent.	If we execute death penalty, we will not be better than murderers.
3.333333333	28237	7933	2	310	3	0	0	1	The death penalty doesn't need to serve as a deterrent to crime.	The death penalty is the best possible deterrent for crime.
2.333333333	5065	4690	1	119	1	22	3	1	Hitler killed a whole race, you are basically saying you don't mind if we kill a bunch of innocent people as long as we get guilty people as well.	There are also people who will tell you that the death penalty actually kills innocent people.
2.666666667	4690	28050	147	114	1	1	1	3	I agree that the people who are killed are mostly innocent people and that those killed by the death penalty are almost certainly guilty of the crime.	Exactly how many innocent people has the death penalty killed?
1	17	33045	131	23	1	3	1	3	If the death penalty were an adequate deterrent then we would not have murder.	If we execute death penalty, we will not be better than murderers.
1	28050	1676	178	21	3	0	21	1	With all that it has been a very trying time for me and I have had to struggle with how I really felt about the death penalty.	The death penalty right now is to easy even I think.
3	20886	28050	23	42	3	0	0	3	I think America should ban the death penalty because no man/woman has the right to kill anyone even if the have done something wrong, because i believe that only God should have the power to take people's lives.	I don't think the death penalty should be banned.
4	373	30812	11	36	1	1	0	3	Death penalty are given to those who have comitted a very serious crime.	Capital punishment is killing someone as a punishment for a crime they committed.
2	4690	18153	90	54	1	0	2	3	If you think there shouldn't be a death penalty, you're an idiot.	As far as I know, you may as well ACTUALLY believe any number of things, if you actually believe in the death penalty.
1.666666667	31664	4690	65	87	3	0	16	1	We could get the person who may kill in the future.	Actually we still kill the wrong person all the time.
1.333333333	5572	9872	292	23	1	9	15	1	Is it reason to do away with the death penalty?	Deterrence is not the only reason I support the death penalty.
2.666666667	28050	36893	3	31	3	4	5	3	All of this information is the reason the Death penalty is so costly.	There is no reason that the death penalty, in general, should be more expensive than LWOP and, in many, if not most cases, the death penalty should be less expensive.
3.333333333	28050	28237	196	10	3	0	10	3	The first twenty states with higher murder rates all have the death penalty.	Most other first-world countries don't have the death penalty, but have lower rates of crime, just pointing that out.
1.333333333	4690	4690	62	42	1	13	8	1	(If a murderer is released and murders again, that has nothing to do with the death penalty, rather the sentencing laws, so doesn't contribute to the number of lives saved by the death penalty).	Both the death penalty and a life sentence would have prevent further murders.
2.333333333	5572	4690	263	82	1	7	14	1	If it has ever happened that a man convicted of murder was legally released, and killed yet again, one (or even a few) incident is laughable in the face of the number of innocent people put on death row.	The few cases that convict innocent people are becoming even fewer.
1	4690	373	76	28	1	3	3	1	Oh, and by the way, the criteria that I mentioned earlier was enough to kill someone for treason, so why shouldn't it be enough to kill someone for another crime?	...and if I do someday murder someone, I should be killed.
1.333333333	5304	33045	7	71	1	1	0	3	Yes, the death penalty should be use as a punishment.	However, one advantage with the Death Penalty is you can use it as leverage in plea bargains.
5	17	30812	116	20	1	0	7	3	Death penalty cases involve a lot of appeals and them lawyers are really expensive.	Death penalty cases cost way more because they usual go through a series of costly appeals.
1	4774	823	53	12	1	9	1	1	As of yet, we have not seen fact one that even one innocent person has been put to death.	As it is today, when someone murderers another, the death penalty is considered, as it should be.
1.333333333	32744	13293	41	16	3	6	0	3	I don't believe that they should because if you kill someone, they won't have the chance to either get rehabilitated nor will they have the chance to actually regret what they have done.	I do not think that a government should be unable to kill someone, simply that they almost always should not.
1.666666667	14127	2652	80	10	3	0	1	1	If a person wasn't convicted then they surely wouldn't be murdered by the state.	if a person kills another person it is murder, whether it is sanctioned by the state or not.
1.666666667	28050	14127	45	49	3	0	10	3	To summarize, I think the death penalty should be used, but only in extreme cases.	The death penalty is not used for what it is supposed to be used for.
3	7933	7933	292	11	1	9	0	1	Though I would not call the death penalty murder, I am personally against it.	I don't care if it is in the name of justice or if someone just wants to avenge a death, murder is murder, no matter how it is done.
4	14127	3065	53	108	3	3	60	1	some of the innocent people that have been executed in the	People have been found out to be innocent after the death penalty ha already been carried out....
2	5065	5572	1	192	1	16	1	1	Other countries not having it doesn't say anything about the morality of the death penalty.	Others have said that the death penalty is biblically wrong.
3.666666667	1676	4774	47	77	1	1	4	1	in a sense, the person committing the crime is deterred because he wold bear the burden of sin, which is both the consequence and punishment.	If a person is deterred from commiting a crime it is because fear in that person's mind has prevented him from commiting the crime.
1.333333333	31664	32744	30	41	3	1	6	3	I do not think that a government should be unable to kill someone, simply that they almost always should not.	I say that they should be killed the same way that the person(s) that they killed were.
4.333333333	14510	17	54	128	3	49	1	1	If we don't stop the death penalty now, we will put innocent people to death while we try to fix the problems.	If we can not prevent the innocent from unjust punishment, we should not have the death penalty.
1.666666667	5572	30812	256	83	1	13	2	3	>>>If we are sure they raped & killed those innocent children then we should let them die.	If they know they'll die if caught, they'll likely kill more rape victims and children.
1	3065	25683	95	84	1	0	4	3	Therefore, people will think twice before they choose to commit a crime and also, the death penalty has been proven to deter the crime rate.	i think the death penalty should be abolished because some people are sentenced to deathfor a crime they might have not committed.
1	5572	13175	256	18	1	13	3	3	If a person just raped someone (this is just an example) they shouldn't be killed for it, but something like a mass murdering or serial killing should be dealt with by putting them to death.	If they know they'll die if caught, they'll likely kill more rape victims and children.
3.666666667	7933	14127	228	49	1	5	10	3	To summarize, I think the death penalty should be used, but only in extreme cases.	Besides I'm not saying we should apply the death penalty in all instances of murder for example.
1	3065	2104	95	16	1	0	3	1	People who will commit a crime with life in prison would probably still commit the crime with capital punishment.	i think the death penalty should be abolished because some people are sentenced to deathfor a crime they might have not committed.
1.333333333	5572	13175	39	18	1	14	3	3	If a person just raped someone (this is just an example) they shouldn't be killed for it, but something like a mass murdering or serial killing should be dealt with by putting them to death.	Only if they try to murder somebody after they are in prison do they deserve the death penalty?
4.333333333	28050	22346	202	25	3	25	10	3	Moreover, states without the death penalty have much lower murder rates.	States without the death penalty have fared BETTER in reducing their murder rates than states with the death penalty.
1	22346	373	10	11	3	3	1	1	Capital punishment is killing someone as a punishment for a crime they committed.	Well I think that if someone commits a crime worthy of the death penalty they should get a sentence for life that way they can't be a repeat offender.
4	7933	14510	11	52	1	21	8	3	The death penalty has never been shown to be a deterent to murder.	Unless there can be solid uncontestable evidence shown that the death penalty is significant in deterring crime, this cannot be used as an argument for the death penalty.
4	14510	14127	52	88	3	8	10	3	studies show that the death penalty is not a deterrent (which is one half of the reason for it's use) and murder rates are actually higher in states that have the death penalty (http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/deterrence-states-without-death-penalty-                                       have-had-consistently-lower-murder-rates#stateswithvwithout).	The death penalty has never been shown to be a deterent to murder.
4.333333333	6937	31664	36	25	1	1	2	3	Death penalty is then in this case a lawful murder.	Murder is murder and those who execute the death penalty are murderers as well.
4.666666667	5572	25683	136	112	1	2	6	3	I think only certain people deserve to have the death penalty.	I believe there are certain crimes where the death penalty is an acceptable punishment.
2.333333333	4690	14510	42	37	1	8	13	3	A life sentence does not prevent a murderer from murdering again.	(If a murderer is released and murders again, that has nothing to do with the death penalty, rather the sentencing laws, so doesn't contribute to the number of lives saved by the death penalty).
1.666666667	28050	373	84	11	3	4	1	1	Capital punishment is killing someone as a punishment for a crime they committed.	In all honesty im glad i am not someone who has to decide murder as punishment for someone who has committed crimes.
1	4690	7933	35	11	1	6	0	1	Though I would not call the death penalty murder, I am personally against it.	What I fail to understand is why citizens who are personally uninvolved with a capital crime scream for the death penalty.
4.666666667	30812	4774	9	8	3	0	11	1	God gave to government the legitimate authority to use capital punishment to restrain murder and to punish murderers.	God specifically gives the government permission to punish murderers by death.
2.333333333	28050	2652	115	10	3	0	1	1	If a person wasn't convicted then they surely wouldn't be murdered by the state.	If someone is bad enough to be considered for the death penalty then they must have had sure evidence that they are guilty if they are then they shouldn't deserve the right to live among people they could kill
1	6937	9872	28	23	1	1	15	1	Is it reason to do away with the death penalty?	The reasons given most often for supporting the death penalty are emotional reasons of retribution for the heinous acts of the criminal.
2	31664	13293	30	8	3	1	3	3	I'm not saying that a child's life is worth more than an adults, I'm saying if they killed any one they forfeit their life, because they in return lose what they took from someone else.	I say that they should be killed the same way that the person(s) that they killed were.
3.333333333	17	33642	131	1	1	0	0	3	If murder is wrong than so is the death penalty.	In my opinion the death penalty is the very wrong way to work against criminal activity like murdering!
2.666666667	28050	18153	113	7	3	1	0	3	while it is a fact that innocent people have been placed and convicted to death row condemned to die, there are however people who are guilty and should die.	The people dying from the death penalty are guilty people who have taken the lives of others.
3.333333333	28050	22346	8	25	3	1	10	3	Moreover, states without the death penalty have much lower murder rates.	The crime rate was higher after the death penalty than before it.
2.333333333	22346	4756	10	35	3	3	7	1	I firmly believe that some crimes and criminals are deserving of death.	Well I think that if someone commits a crime worthy of the death penalty they should get a sentence for life that way they can't be a repeat offender.
2	5572	28050	151	93	1	5	0	3	What does them being released have to do with the death penalty?	Life without parole lets you fix that mistake since they can be released if they are found innocent - not so with the death penalty.
4.333333333	4690	4756	44	35	1	0	7	1	I firmly believe that some crimes and criminals are deserving of death.	Because we are all potential victims of violent crime, and I believe that there are violent crimes deserving of the death penalty.
5	28050	14510	37	52	3	22	8	3	The death penalty has never been shown to be a deterent to murder.	In addition, it is evident that the death penalty does not deter murder rates.
4.666666667	1676	5572	59	287	1	6	2	1	Many people argue that the death penalty is not a detterence.	The death penalty is not deterrance for the person executed.
1.333333333	4774	6937	13	36	1	1	1	1	Murder is murder and those who execute the death penalty are murderers as well.	The death penalty executes felons found guilty of especially heinous crimes.
1	13293	2652	8	12	3	3	5	1	Like I said, if the person isn't convicted, then they will not be murdered in the electric chair, or by lethal injection.

3	33642	7933	37	252	3	4	1	1	I'm pro-death penalty because there is no atonement for murder.	If these are indeed comparable, I wouldn't argue for the death penalty even in murder.
1.333333333	22346	33642	20	37	3	0	2	3	The point is that people who care about you will suffer more if you die than if you are tortured or raped.	I see what you mean, but i'm still against killing people .

3	25683	28050	11	66	3	1	0	3	I think the death penalty is an archaic and obsolete form of punishment, even for the crime of murder.	I do feel that those who murder in cold blood would be more than deserving of the death penalty.

Since there is no clear evidence indicating that there is any deterrent value to the death penalty, I have trouble rationalizing it as a punishment.
3.333333333	823	5572	36	266	1	34	22	1	People use the argument that we should not execute people based on the possibility that they may be innocent, but they could care less if we lock someone up for life who may be innocent.

1.666666667	7933	14510	90	20	1	2	5	3	Someone in my family, honestly I would want that person to take the death penalty.	This is why I said the punishment should be decided by the victim or the victims family, and to my knowledge there is nothing in the bible that says that only the state can administer punishment.
1	5572	32744	39	24	1	16	8	3	Killing a person for them killing someone else ( I understand this is not necessarily the criteria for receiving the death penalty) makes you no better than the executed.	You do realize that if they do murder somebody while they are in prison, it will most likely be another prisoner, since the guards are armed?
4.333333333	5572	28050	255	34	1	5	1	3	Does the death penalty deter evil more than life in prison?	But the statistics don't support the idea that the death penalty is any more effective as a detterent than is a life sentence.

I'm against captial punishment for the reasons that wjim1269 gave and also I think that just because someone murders someone it doesn't mean they should automatically forfeit their own life.

By not giving the death penalty to a slaughtering murderer, we are telling the world that the life of this murderer is worth more than that of his victim.
1.666666667	373	13293	5	13	1	2	6	3	Back to reality, we convict the wrong person all the time, and we've set up a system where death penalty is actually more expensive than life in prison.	If we sentence someone to life in prison, we can always free them at a later time if they are found to be innocent.

1.333333333	28050	7933	84	2	3	12	12	1	In any case, while I believe some criminals should just be carried into the street and shot, I don't think the death penalty is worth it in today's society.	I dont think the death penalty should be apllied in just any case.
3	32744	3186	26	95	3	4	26	1	I am pro-death penalty even though I conceed that every study I have seen suggests it does absolutely nothing to deter capitol crimes.	I feel as though you're implying that the death penalty is an effective crime deterrent.
3	4756	25683	59	86	1	7	31	3	Can life imprisonment for a definite yes, prevent a murderer from killing again?	Life incarceration will never let him kill again, and its cheaper.

1.666666667	4690	17	32	128	1	0	3	1	If we don't stop the death penalty before we try to fix it, the imperfect system will continue to convict innocent people while we determine what is best for it.	So if we can assume that innocent people are convicted in capital punishment cases, shouldn't we be free to assume that innocent people are being convicted in non-capital punishment cases as well?
1	18153	14510	41	11	3	3	1	3	There has been so much cases of people who have been executed, only to be found innocent after their death.	The Death penalty does not work because the kind of people that murder will not stop and think of the consequences before their actions.
1	5572	14127	221	60	1	3	22	3	You can't just assume the death penalty is a crime.	You can't get much worse than a death penalty.
1.333333333	3186	4690	80	32	1	7	17	1	No letting the family or friends of the victim kill the convicted person might be childish revenge.	But killing someone because of him killing someone is quite hypocritical.
1.333333333	22346	15556	9	15	3	8	3	3	Some crimes are so heinous that the person who committed the crime deserves to die: I would only agree to this if the execution erased the crime that was committed in the first place.	The non-repeat offenders are typically people who committed much smaller crimes that would never be worthy of the death penalty in the first place.
1	5572	1128	188	5	1	0	0	1	"I am ""for"" capital punishment... but if a criminal shows a desire for death over a life sentence, I prefer to be sadistic."	I think that criminals view the death penalty as worse than life imprisonment and worse than temporary solitary confinement within life imprisonment - at least given the conditions in American prisons.
2	32744	373	26	37	3	4	2	1	It's cheap, I'd say as effective as preventing crime as the death penalty (would you want to spend the rest of your life doing labor in Alaska?	I feel as though you're implying that the death penalty is an effective crime deterrent.
2.333333333	14127	4690	79	119	3	4	11	1	The death penalty doesn't reverse the death of the victim.	the use of the death penalty is an act of revenge which cannot be undone, so should the state be put on trial for putting to death an innocent person?
3	1128	33045	5	90	1	0	0	3	I think that if the murderer wants the death penalty, they should be allowed it if the victim's family agrees- but for crimes of passion and misunderstanding, no death penalty.	"I am ""for"" capital punishment... but if a criminal shows a desire for death over a life sentence, I prefer to be sadistic."
3	1128	823	23	16	1	1	10	1	It is also possible for an innocent person to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, but nobody is making the argument to stop sending people to prison.	They shouldn't want to send an innocent person to prison for life either so it should have been pretty clear they were guilty already.
3.666666667	25683	25683	53	67	3	11	1	3	Point out how many executions are taking place per year and compared to that the murder rate and tell me what you are seeing.	Do you expect 12 executions per year to deter a murder rate of the above mentioned amount?
1.333333333	25683	1676	81	21	3	0	21	1	With all that it has been a very trying time for me and I have had to struggle with how I really felt about the death penalty.	Last time I checked, killing doesn't bring persons back to life, so the only reason for the death penalty seems to be revenge.
1	31664	5572	54	287	3	26	2	1	Many people argue that the death penalty is not a detterence.	There are a lot of people who argue against the death penalty on principle nonetheless the financial.
2	31664	4774	23	8	3	10	11	1	God gave to government the legitimate authority to use capital punishment to restrain murder and to punish murderers.	Death penalty is lawful (in some states) because a majority of the people has agreed to give the justice system the power to kill with our permission.
2.333333333	1676	20886	78	1	1	12	1	3	If I were charged to do something that forced me to spend the rest of my life in jail, I would rather die right now - I think they're doing the criminal a favor by putting him down.	If someone killed my relative, I wouldn't want them killed, I would want them to spend the rest of their lives in hard, back breaking labor.
3	31664	4690	9	138	3	0	5	1	But it costs more, kills more innocents, and has no more advantages to life in prison.	So your argument is that if the death penalty was cheaper than life in prison it would have the advantage of being cheaper than life in prison.
1	17	3065	134	67	1	4	0	1	How do you compare killing a little child who has never had the chance to live to the execution of a criminal who has been raping and killing little children?	By killing a person who murdered someone, you are just doing the same thing you are punishing him/her for.
1	2104	18153	66	20	1	1	9	3	If we focused on the death penalty in the trial, we wouldn't have those costs.	If capital punishment works (deterrent), why do we have such a high murder rate per capita?
2.666666667	25683	28237	90	10	3	1	10	3	The first twenty states with higher murder rates all have the death penalty.	The murder rate for the state of New York, a state without the death penalty has increased this year with a higher rate of murder than it was in 2009.
1.666666667	12024	28050	9	34	3	0	1	3	Does the death penalty deter evil more than life in prison?	it has been proven time and again prisons don't rehabilitate, keeping someone in prision for their entire life in prision is less human than the death penalty.
3	31664	14127	54	60	3	1	27	3	Saying the death penalty is a justified method of punishment for a crime just because the criminal is a killer himself is a completely contrived reason.	The truth is that the Death Penalty punishes those who have convicted a crime of extreme severity, not any criminal who commits a crime.
4.666666667	12024	28050	4	23	3	3	2	3	Granted, someone, who bestows great harm onto a family for egregious acts, doesn't give the government the right to kill that person.	The government doesn't have the right to take away someone's life, even in the case of murder.
2.333333333	8212	8212	16	17	3	4	2	3	So, no, it doesn't prevent criminals from continuing their crimes -- they wouldn't continue anyway.	The death penalty is gives the ability to off killers and murderers, as, if they were given life in parole, they have the ability to escape and continue their crimes.
1.666666667	22346	25683	25	7	3	0	27	3	There is no reason to give that person a death penalty.	There are many reasons the death penalty should be abolished.
3	373	14127	19	49	1	1	10	3	To summarize, I think the death penalty should be used, but only in extreme cases.	I think the death penalty should only be used when there is undeniable proof against the suspect.
1	6937	7933	5	263	1	6	6	1	One does not have to witness an execution to be aware one took place.	in fact the ones against the death penalty ARE FOR ABORTION!
3	1676	1676	59	44	1	6	2	1	The death penalty should not be catagorized as a deterrent.	The death penalty is not deterrance for the person executed.
2.666666667	5572	28050	266	1	1	22	6	3	People have, and will, be executed even though they are innocent of the crime.	People use the argument that we should not execute people based on the possibility that they may be innocent, but they could care less if we lock someone up for life who may be innocent.
1.333333333	30812	25683	113	110	3	0	0	3	I see no point in letting someone live who does not want to live, or letting someone die who does not want to die.	I believe that if person takes the life of another, he should lose his life.
2.666666667	33642	4756	1	68	3	1	18	1	They support it because killing murderers is the right thing to do.	You might say the criminal deserved it, but murder is murder, whether they deserved it or not.
3.333333333	5572	823	201	16	1	3	10	1	It is also possible for an innocent person to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, but nobody is making the argument to stop sending people to prison.	There is an even smaller chance of an innocent person being sent to prison for the rest of their life, let alone to be convicted of a crime and sent to death.
1	7933	25683	314	85	1	2	9	3	Almost every study I've seen on the deterrent effect of the death penalty has suggested that it's no more effective than life imprisonment.	Some innocent people are still sentenced to death, and that's where I see a problem.
2.333333333	7933	3065	310	74	1	0	12	1	Hypothetically, fear of the death penalty could help prevent future crimes.	The death penalty doesn't need to serve as a deterrent to crime.
1	5572	4756	36	62	1	19	15	1	If somebody is completely innocent and they are executed for a crime they didn't commit (which, with forensics these days, probably will never happen again), that is a problem.	We shouldn't just kill someone if they commit a crime.
4	28237	31664	2	27	3	0	3	3	The thing is, without the death penalty there is absolutely no deterrent from committing heinous crimes.	The death penalty is the best possible deterrent for crime.
2.666666667	30697	28050	19	26	3	2	1	3	Without the trials and appeals, death penalty cases would be much cheaper than confining inmates for the rest of their lives.	The fact remains that life in prison is cheaper than sentencing one to the death penalty.
1	28050	5572	203	70	3	18	0	1	The person who said that the death penalty should be used for people who are convicted of multiple-burglaries sounds like a complete knucklehead.	The death penalty has been used as a scapegoat for many people who are against executions.
3	30812	3186	93	8	3	0	0	1	I do not support the death penalty - but it's not because I feel bad for criminals.	For sheer purposes of punishing a criminal, I don't support the death penalty.
3	4756	7933	18	310	1	1	0	1	The death penalty doesn't need to serve as a deterrent to crime.	Because justice operates to protect society by deterring future crime, one would have to show that the death penalty prevents more crime than life in prison, thus fulfilling the function of justice better than that of life in prison.
1	30812	15556	22	15	3	3	9	3	Capital punishment frees up jail cells: Considering how few people we execute and how many new people enter the prison system each year, I do not see this as being a very good argument.	The way I see it people who murder shouldn't be sentenced to death or spend life in the jails we have here there to nice.
1.666666667	28050	4756	114	62	3	1	49	1	Essentially, you believe a fetus should be allowed to be killed simply for existing, while you protect the lives of people who have murdered other innocent people (as murder is generally what a person will get the death penalty for).	I agree that the people who are killed are mostly innocent people and that those killed by the death penalty are almost certainly guilty of the crime.
1	3065	7933	23	265	1	5	3	1	So what does he have to do with a debate like this about murderers and the death penalty?	Although there is much controversy about him, I agree that prisons, especially for those for whom the death penalty could be considered, should be punishment.
3.333333333	36893	22346	1	7	3	0	1	3	And the purpose of the death penalty is not to punish, but to deter further crime.	Yes, death penalty is not a qualified punishment for a crime.
2.333333333	4756	2652	7	30	1	2	9	1	All of the death penalty oppontents are for life in jail as opposed to the death penalty.I am sure that if some are found innocent,there are at least that many that are innocent and never set free.	A thorough review finds that death penalty opponents have lied, extensively, regarding the numbers of innocents sentenced to death, that such risk is extraordinarily low and that the cessation of executions will put many more innocents at risk.
2.333333333	25683	28050	14	151	3	2	11	3	The studies are very clear that people are routinely convicted of crimes that they never committed, period.	Did you study when these people were exonerated and in what year were they placed on the death penalty?
1.333333333	2104	1128	7	40	1	4	0	1	I guess the question begs to be asked to my friends on the left is If life in prisonment is so much worse then the death penalty why do you think most prisoners on death row would choose that option?	I am advocating life in prison without the option of parole.
3	7933	5572	2	39	1	6	0	1	Actually, the idea that the death penalty costs more than lifetime imprisonment has been disproved many times.	With trials and appeals, one execution can end up costing more than a life sentence by the time the execution is actually carried out.
3	28050	5572	36	255	3	1	5	1	But the statistics don't support the idea that the death penalty is any more effective as a detterent than is a life sentence.	The death penalty is sometimes claimed to save lives through deterrence.
2.666666667	25683	4690	11	44	3	1	0	1	Because we are all potential victims of violent crime, and I believe that there are violent crimes deserving of the death penalty.	I do feel that those who murder in cold blood would be more than deserving of the death penalty.
1	25683	17	14	33	3	2	16	1	An argument for putting people to death is so that they can never escape and kill again.	Did you study when these people were exonerated and in what year were they placed on the death penalty?
2.666666667	5572	8200	216	20	1	2	1	3	The reason why I'm for death penalty is because some people can be so dangerous fir the society, like serial murderer or maniac, so that they must be punished by this method.	I believe that societies should punish criminals to the degree that they have to based on sound rational reasons.
1	5572	33045	150	77	1	1	0	3	If someone is wrongly convicted of a crime and put in jail, they can be released if they're found to be innocent.	Some prisons are actually prisons instead of criminal resorts, and those are the best to put scum like them in.

2	2104	25683	66	90	1	1	1	3	The murder rate for the state of New York, a state without the death penalty has increased this year with a higher rate of murder than it was in 2009.	If capital punishment works (deterrent), why do we have such a high murder rate per capita?
3	14127	30812	43	101	3	1	3	3	"Death penalty is similar to ""an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth""which is too inhuman."	I do believe in the death Penalty, eye for and eye.
3.666666667	4690	25683	185	35	1	27	0	3	Your description, that the death penalty is a deterrent, is incorrect.	Furthermore, any assertion that the death penalty is not a deterrent is false.
1	31664	25683	19	90	3	4	33	3	The death penalty again has not only shown but proved to deter murder so therefore i wpuld suggest you reconsider your closing arguments.	You can't undo the death penalty if it turns out evidence was fabricated or what have you.
1	7836	31664	19	48	3	0	0	3	Not sure how the death penalty is the more effective solution.	"There cannot be a ""no"" answer since the death penalty is already legal."
2.666666667	373	2104	2	33	1	5	1	1	politicaly correct death penalty we impose here in America may not deter crime as well as we think it should.	If we slap a guarantueed death penalty on murder then any following murderer commits the crime on pain of death which is a much better detterent.
1	373	32744	5	42	1	2	2	3	If it must be, then we shall find a way to improve these peoples habits, not kill them because they aren't 'like us'.	If we sentence someone to life in prison, we can always free them at a later time if they are found to be innocent.
1.666666667	28050	14510	35	20	3	0	13	3	So, when someone gets the death penalty, they chose their own fate by committing the crime.	The death penalty is useless deterrent of crime because in the states that have them, they are not any more inclined to commit a crime because the threat of death penalty particularly if it is murder.
1.666666667	5572	1676	188	16	1	0	6	1	I think it could be proven that putting somebody in prison for life whent ehy have requested the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment.	I think that criminals view the death penalty as worse than life imprisonment and worse than temporary solitary confinement within life imprisonment - at least given the conditions in American prisons.
1.333333333	28050	7933	66	244	3	0	5	1	And no, I don't the death penalty is murder.	I think the death penalty is an archaic and obsolete form of punishment, even for the crime of murder.
4.333333333	4690	30812	32	36	1	18	0	3	Death penalty are given to those who have comitted a very serious crime.	The death penalty is simply a legally imposed punishment given to felons who commited crimes for which the death penalty is applicable.
2.333333333	28050	28050	196	8	3	0	1	3	The crime rate was higher after the death penalty than before it.	Most other first-world countries don't have the death penalty, but have lower rates of crime, just pointing that out.
3.333333333	4690	2652	147	25	1	1	2	1	My argument is that innocent people have been killed by the death penalty.	Exactly how many innocent people has the death penalty killed?
1	32206	14510	20	24	3	3	2	3	if someone killed you wouldn't you want them dead?	You make it sound as though if someone is innocent, of anything, they should be killed.
2.666666667	31664	5572	52	181	3	6	1	1	How many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent?	As long as we sentence people to a life in prison we are also GUARANTEED to sentence an innocent person.
4.666666667	13526	14127	5	49	3	0	10	3	To summarize, I think the death penalty should be used, but only in extreme cases.	If the justice system is organized and operated correctly, then I believe the death penalty should be used, but it should only be used in very severe cases.
3	30697	31664	19	9	3	2	0	3	So your argument is that if the death penalty was cheaper than life in prison it would have the advantage of being cheaper than life in prison.	The fact remains that life in prison is cheaper than sentencing one to the death penalty.
1.333333333	107	9872	13	23	1	7	15	1	Is it reason to do away with the death penalty?	What does this have to do with the death penalty?
1	5065	4756	1	62	1	22	49	1	Essentially, you believe a fetus should be allowed to be killed simply for existing, while you protect the lives of people who have murdered other innocent people (as murder is generally what a person will get the death penalty for).	There are also people who will tell you that the death penalty actually kills innocent people.
2	373	14510	11	20	1	1	13	3	So, when someone gets the death penalty, they chose their own fate by committing the crime.	Capital punishment is killing someone as a punishment for a crime they committed.
1.666666667	32744	18153	7	54	3	4	2	3	If you think there shouldn't be a death penalty, you're an idiot.	You are against of violence, but have you ever thought that death penalty is also violence?
1	28050	7933	105	244	3	1	5	1	And no, I don't the death penalty is murder.	, I believe the death penalty has deterred at least some people from committing murder.
1	28050	33045	203	71	3	18	0	3	Yes, the death penalty should be use as a punishment.	The death penalty has been used as a scapegoat for many people who are against executions.
1.333333333	5572	14510	248	24	1	3	2	3	if someone killed you wouldn't you want them dead?	So, the question remains, why kill them if you don't need to.
3	17	823	128	12	1	1	1	1	As of yet, we have not seen fact one that even one innocent person has been put to death.	If we don't stop the death penalty now, we will put innocent people to death while we try to fix the problems.

It is also possible for an innocent person to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, but nobody is making the argument to stop sending people to prison.
2	28050	373	45	19	3	0	1	1	I think the death penalty should only be used when there is undeniable proof against the suspect.	The death penalty is not used for what it is supposed to be used for.
1.333333333	28050	823	84	9	3	12	1	1	If that is the case I am against Capital Punishment.	I dont think the death penalty should be apllied in just any case.
1.333333333	2659	13175	39	22	1	0	0	3	I think the death penalty should only be used in extreme cases where the accused is, without a doubt, guilty.	I used to be for the death penalty, however two things made me question my position.

1	31664	18153	61	51	3	20	2	3	There shouldn't be a death penalty it isn't fair.	Death penalty does not have a clear and definite criterion.
3.666666667	2659	3271	31	39	1	4	3	1	The fact is that as long as we have a death penalty (the only Western nation to have it), we will execute innocents with the guilty.	That doesn't ensure that we don't end up murdering innocent people.
1	14127	17	30	25	3	0	5	1	And because Christ forgave the men that unjustly killed him does not conclusivly show that He was against the death penalty.	No the death penalty in not hateful because it is performed due to the fact that he killed someone.
2.666666667	7933	28237	2	8	1	6	7	3	Life imprisonment without parole is more effective than execution, and it is cheaper.	With trials and appeals, one execution can end up costing more than a life sentence by the time the execution is actually carried out.

1.666666667	28050	14127	147	79	3	18	4	3	the use of the death penalty is an act of revenge which cannot be undone, so should the state be put on trial for putting to death an innocent person?	Firstly there has been no proof that an Innocent man has ever been placed on death row.
1.333333333	3065	7933	5	207	1	5	17	1	Also, I wonder if a criminal thinks of the punishment when he commits the crime - if he were counting on being punished, he wouldn't have done it.	Well one thing for sure the muderer or rapist who is executed will never commit those crimes again........He is permanently deterred........
1	6937	5572	29	183	1	2	1	1	"I suppose you could say ""well it keeps them from harming society"" but so does the death penalty."	And no, I do not claim that there are trials that can determine innocence after execution...we hold those while they are alive, and before they are sentenced to death.
1	4756	7933	9	2	1	1	12	1	In any case, while I believe some criminals should just be carried into the street and shot, I don't think the death penalty is worth it in today's society.	By the way, I believe I�۪m correct in saying there has not been an innocent person put to death since 1900.
2.333333333	4690	5572	107	85	1	8	28	1	I have a lot of sympathy for ex-convicts, but I still favor the death penalty.	I am not a big proponent of the death penalty.
1	3065	18153	23	41	1	5	0	3	Well I, as creator of this debate, think that there should not be a death penalty.	Although there is much controversy about him, I agree that prisons, especially for those for whom the death penalty could be considered, should be punishment.
2	12024	4690	20	20	3	11	13	1	If the person in question is in prison, they are removed from society.	People sentenced to life in prison shouldn't languish in cells, they should be doing something to aid the society they injured.
3.666666667	373	30812	5	20	1	12	7	3	Death penalty cases involve a lot of appeals and them lawyers are really expensive.	A death penalty case is likely to be appealed as high as it will be taken.
4.333333333	17	31664	33	39	1	16	1	3	What if there were people killing other people, escaping from jail, doing it again etc.	An argument for putting people to death is so that they can never escape and kill again.
1	3065	2358	23	5	1	5	0	1	I'm sure he's guilty, but I am against the death penalty.	Although there is much controversy about him, I agree that prisons, especially for those for whom the death penalty could be considered, should be punishment.
1.333333333	18153	5572	55	183	3	1	1	1	"I suppose you could say ""well it keeps them from harming society"" but so does the death penalty."	I don't think preventing the death of more humans is idiocy.
1	1128	33642	3	37	1	1	2	3	The point is that people who care about you will suffer more if you die than if you are tortured or raped.	Death is a much kinder sentence than life in prison, if you are sentenced to life, you should get to suffer for the whole bit.
5	28050	31664	215	56	3	2	14	3	In the United States, states without the death penalty has consistently lower murder rates.	Also, within the USA, murder rates are consistently lower in states that don't have capital punishment.

4.333333333	28237	5572	10	196	3	9	7	1	States without the death penalty generally have lower murder rates.	Since murder is viewed as wrong, it generally makes more sense to eliminate the death penalty because murder rates are generally lower in those states.

2	28050	33045	45	71	3	0	0	3	Yes, the death penalty should be use as a punishment.	The death penalty is not used for what it is supposed to be used for.
2.666666667	28050	5572	36	287	3	1	2	1	Many people argue that the death penalty is not a detterence.	The death penalty is sometimes claimed to save lives through deterrence.
2.333333333	3065	5572	88	4	1	5	0	1	I find it rather odd that many of the countries that ban the death penalty allow abortion as if killing a killer is worse than killing an innocent life.	abortion does not qualify as state murder like the death penalty.
1.333333333	7933	7933	126	259	1	5	5	1	The only question is whether or not any risk of executing an innocent is acceptable.	The death penalty is the only acceptable answer in this case.

4	5572	5572	266	114	1	9	3	1	So tell me, why do you consider it punishment to lock someone in a cage for the rest of their life (sometimes 60+ years), yet it is automatically revenge to execute them?	However, I do not see any moral difference in locking up an innocent person for 60 year or executing an innocent person.
4.333333333	28050	28050	102	37	3	0	26	3	On blurtit.com, their is a survey that shows 55% of people would prefer the death penalty to life in jail.	In fact mudkipz, many people would prefer the death penalty of life in jail.
4.333333333	28050	4690	37	55	3	9	10	1	Morality aside, no evidence of deterrence aside, the death penalty costs more than life imprisonment.	Living in jail for life costs less money then the death penalty.
1	4690	4690	149	47	1	7	3	1	If we fail to execute murderers, and doing so would in fact have deterred other murders, we have allowed the killing of a bunch of innocent victims.	We seem to have more compassion for the victims and potential victims of murderers than we do for the murderers.
1.666666667	25683	28050	89	102	3	25	0	3	In fact mudkipz, many people would prefer the death penalty of life in jail.	The death penalty has not been shown to be more effective than life imprisonment in deterring murder, hence we should choose life imprisonment.
1	28050	25683	99	7	3	2	22	3	I highly doubt the backing of why you personally would want the death penalty invoked is because you're worried at home that a mass murderer is going to escape and kill you or someone you love... seriously?	You are probably going to murder somebody; hopefully it will b in a place with the death penalty and then you will get what you deserve.
4	2104	28050	66	37	1	1	22	3	In addition, it is evident that the death penalty does not deter murder rates.	If capital punishment works (deterrent), why do we have such a high murder rate per capita?
3	28050	25683	210	67	3	0	10	3	If the execution rate decreased and the murder rate increased then that explains the deterrence effect of capital punishment.	If the death penalty deters murder (as you claim) then why does Europe have a lower murder rate even though they've outlawed the death penalty?
1	7933	20886	40	4	1	1	1	3	The government does not have the right to kill people.	So as long as only some innocent people are killed for crimes they didn't commit then the system must be sound.
1	5572	25683	255	110	1	1	0	3	I see no point in letting someone live who does not want to live, or letting someone die who does not want to die.	If I heard of an innocent stranger being brutally killed, I might want to see the perpetrator suffer because of the suffering of the victim - that is VENGEANCE pure and simple.
1	7933	1676	12	21	1	9	21	1	With all that it has been a very trying time for me and I have had to struggle with how I really felt about the death penalty.	While I am not against execution, I would rather see tax dollars go to something a bit more useful than trying to execute one person.

2	28050	25683	37	73	3	22	3	3	If there was another factor associated with the increase in the murder rate and not the death penalty, then the article itself would have pointed it out.	In addition, it is evident that the death penalty does not deter murder rates.
1	31664	17	27	63	3	6	13	1	I would rather have justice be done than to give a rapist the chance to grab another little girl or a murderer to have the chance to kill an innocent person I might know or care about.	It wouldn't shock me if someone committed murder JUST to get those things.
1.333333333	32744	13293	24	16	3	8	0	3	I don't believe that they should because if you kill someone, they won't have the chance to either get rehabilitated nor will they have the chance to actually regret what they have done.	Killing a person for them killing someone else ( I understand this is not necessarily the criteria for receiving the death penalty) makes you no better than the executed.
1	22346	30697	10	7	3	3	2	3	For that I do not disagree, yes hundreds maybe thousands of people have either been sentenced to death or served a period of time in jail for a crime they did not commit.	Well I think that if someone commits a crime worthy of the death penalty they should get a sentence for life that way they can't be a repeat offender.
3.333333333	3186	14127	80	80	1	7	0	3	if a person kills another person it is murder, whether it is sanctioned by the state or not.	But killing someone because of him killing someone is quite hypocritical.
1.333333333	17	17	64	136	1	2	1	1	So we kill killers, but in the end, end up with more murders.	If someone keeps killing and killing and killing, we need to stop him from taking lives.
2.666666667	31664	7933	27	310	3	3	0	1	The death penalty doesn't need to serve as a deterrent to crime.	The thing is, without the death penalty there is absolutely no deterrent from committing heinous crimes.

1.333333333	22346	14510	25	37	3	38	13	3	A life sentence does not prevent a murderer from murdering again.	In every state that retains the death penalty, jurors have the option of sentencing convicted capital murderers to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
1	9676	14510	21	24	1	1	2	3	if someone killed you wouldn't you want them dead?	You cannot kill somebody just because they've broken into your house, you have to have a well founded fear of harm.

After all, the person you're torturing may actually be innocent.
2	7933	28050	228	20	1	5	0	3	I assume in what follows that we, the country or the state, execute only for the crime of murder, though many capital punishment adherents would use it for other crimes, such as child rape, treason, arson, robbery and even fraud.

4.333333333	25683	3065	88	8	3	27	2	1	The deterrent of the death penalty cannot be directed at the executed, but does put fear in the minds of other potential capital criminals.	The death penalty again, in giving punishing the offender sends out a message to others that no one should kill or hurt another person which will thus serve to deter other potential killers.

1.333333333	5065	14510	1	11	1	4	1	3	There has been so much cases of people who have been executed, only to be found innocent after their death.	The death penalty is the only just punishment for their actions.
3.333333333	5572	17	265	121	1	0	3	1	By the same token, if we keep administering the death penalty while the system is broken, we will have a much greater risk of putting someone innocent to death.	So how about we stop a penalty that has executed innocents?
2.333333333	4756	14127	18	89	1	1	13	3	And no, society is not better served by life imprisonment than the death penalty because society then learns that consequences aren't very severe for committing an act of murder.	Because justice operates to protect society by deterring future crime, one would have to show that the death penalty prevents more crime than life in prison, thus fulfilling the function of justice better than that of life in prison.
1	22346	25683	20	67	3	0	1	3	Point out how many executions are taking place per year and compared to that the murder rate and tell me what you are seeing.	I see what you mean, but i'm still against killing people .
3	5572	7933	260	252	1	1	1	1	I'm pro-death penalty because there is no atonement for murder.	This is why I'm aganist the penalty as punishment.
2	1128	4756	16	11	1	3	4	1	Again, I support the death penalty for certain crimes and criminals.	But as long as they are only options, I support the criminals right to choose that particular method.
3.666666667	7933	1676	11	35	1	21	4	1	Therefore the argument of death as a deterent is a joke.	Unless there can be solid uncontestable evidence shown that the death penalty is significant in deterring crime, this cannot be used as an argument for the death penalty.
1	28050	14510	84	20	3	4	13	3	So, when someone gets the death penalty, they chose their own fate by committing the crime.	In all honesty im glad i am not someone who has to decide murder as punishment for someone who has committed crimes.
3.666666667	28237	20886	2	3	3	0	4	3	The death penalty has been found to be a more effective deterrent to crimes against children.	The death penalty is the best possible deterrent for crime.
2.666666667	4690	25683	147	50	1	2	1	3	I have evidence that says that innocent people are convicted of crimes.	From what I have read, there has been no conclusive evidence of an innocent person killed by the death penalty since 1900.
1.333333333	4690	107	119	13	1	11	7	1	What does this have to do with the death penalty?	The death penalty doesn't reverse the death of the victim.
4	13526	4756	8	35	3	7	7	1	I firmly believe that some crimes and criminals are deserving of death.	So all in all I believe in the death penalty.

3.666666667	5572	5572	260	265	1	1	1	1	I'm more aganist the penalty because it costs so damn much over life.	This is why I'm aganist the penalty as punishment.
4.666666667	28050	28050	64	64	3	9	3	3	The death sentence has been used since the beginning of the United States, and rarely, if ever, has there been an occurrence in which someone avenges the death of a murderer or rapist.	There has seldom if ever been any occurrence in which someone has violently avenged a murderer's death.
4	25683	5065	58	1	3	4	22	1	There are also people who will tell you that the death penalty actually kills innocent people.	therefore the death penalty should not be used, simply because it kills innocent people.
2.666666667	17	17	33	33	1	16	17	1	Only .06% of people who have killed kill again when they escape, are released, etc.	An argument for putting people to death is so that they can never escape and kill again.

2.666666667	823	7933	9	25	1	8	6	1	I think I could kill someone trying to kill any one of my children.	If someone were to torture and kill one of my kids, I don�۪t think killing them would be punishment enough.
1	28050	25683	203	58	3	18	4	3	therefore the death penalty should not be used, simply because it kills innocent people.	The death penalty has been used as a scapegoat for many people who are against executions.
3	7933	6937	244	36	1	5	1	1	Murder is murder and those who execute the death penalty are murderers as well.	And no, I don't the death penalty is murder.
1.333333333	25683	9872	7	23	3	27	15	1	Is it reason to do away with the death penalty?	There is no reason to give that person a death penalty.
1.333333333	107	18153	13	51	1	7	2	3	There shouldn't be a death penalty it isn't fair.	What does this have to do with the death penalty?
1.333333333	107	4690	13	18	1	7	5	1	It is called the death penalty for a reason...it is a penalty, a punishment.	What does this have to do with the death penalty?

2.666666667	13526	28050	8	105	3	7	1	3	, I believe the death penalty has deterred at least some people from committing murder.	So all in all I believe in the death penalty.

1.333333333	2659	17	31	136	1	4	1	1	So we kill killers, but in the end, end up with more murders.	That doesn't ensure that we don't end up murdering innocent people.
2.666666667	33045	7933	71	228	3	0	9	1	Justice is applying a penalty or punishment for a wrong deed done.	Yes, the death penalty should be use as a punishment.
2	13526	4690	8	204	3	7	10	1	I don't believe the death penalty should be allowed for circumstantial evidenc.	So all in all I believe in the death penalty.
4.333333333	1676	3065	22	107	1	5	0	1	I am a case by case pro, Some people simply need to be put to death for the crimes they have commited so that others are protected.	There are some who need to be put to death.
4	13526	30812	25	108	3	1	0	3	I think instead of a death penalty, they should just stay in prison until they die because putting someone to death is just harsh, No matter who it is.	I personally would never wish death penalty on someone no matter what they did to me/family/friends I would just want them in jail for a life sentence because then the threat is pretty much over.
1.333333333	4690	28050	147	68	1	1	7	3	And if it doesn't... the people who have killed the most under the death penalty will end up strapped to that bed too if they make it a capital offense to accidentally kill an innocent person.	Exactly how many innocent people has the death penalty killed?
3	25683	5572	42	97	3	15	2	1	We let killers out of prison so they can kill again.	Even if the death penalty does not deter serial killers, it prevents them from killing again in society or in prison.
2.333333333	6937	13175	32	1	1	2	4	3	There have been numerous people who were presumed innocent after execution because the evidence showed that they were not guilty.	Obviously, if someone were found innocent before execution, they would not be executed.
1.333333333	4774	4756	53	62	1	9	49	1	Essentially, you believe a fetus should be allowed to be killed simply for existing, while you protect the lives of people who have murdered other innocent people (as murder is generally what a person will get the death penalty for).	As it is today, when someone murderers another, the death penalty is considered, as it should be.

3	33045	4690	23	47	3	1	3	1	If we fail to execute murderers, and doing so would in fact have deterred other murders, we have allowed the killing of a bunch of innocent victims.	If the death penalty were an adequate deterrent then we would not have murder.
1	1676	4774	59	53	1	6	9	1	As it is today, when someone murderers another, the death penalty is considered, as it should be.	The death penalty is not deterrance for the person executed.
4	31664	823	52	16	3	6	10	1	It is also possible for an innocent person to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, but nobody is making the argument to stop sending people to prison.	As long as we sentence people to a life in prison we are also GUARANTEED to sentence an innocent person.
4	30697	32744	17	21	3	0	1	3	I mean that if the death penalty would be legalized, people will scare to commit the crime.	Death penalty should be allowed as it deters people from committing serious crimes such as murder.

The people dying from the death penalty are guilty people who have taken the lives of others.
2	14127	5572	79	196	3	6	6	1	Most people who would be deterred already seem to be deterred by life without parole as a punishment.	i think that life without opportunity of parole is the more humane and just punishment instead of the death penalty.
2.333333333	4690	3271	32	39	1	0	3	1	The fact is that as long as we have a death penalty (the only Western nation to have it), we will execute innocents with the guilty.	So if we can assume that innocent people are convicted in capital punishment cases, shouldn't we be free to assume that innocent people are being convicted in non-capital punishment cases as well?
1	28050	4690	77	18	3	2	3	1	And it seems that every time we start talking about the death penalty, that we end up talking about whether or not it deters crime.	maybe we should start with what crimes warrant the death penalty.
1	33045	32744	38	21	3	21	1	3	I mean that if the death penalty would be legalized, people will scare to commit the crime.	I don't even give a shit about the death penalty, I was just making a point.
2	823	6937	13	32	1	2	2	1	Obviously, if someone were found innocent before execution, they would not be executed.	DNA testing capabilities allowed them to determine that the executed men were, in fact, innocent.
3	14127	25683	36	90	3	15	33	3	The death penalty again has not only shown but proved to deter murder so therefore i wpuld suggest you reconsider your closing arguments.	That comment implies that you see the death penalty as a deterrent.
1.333333333	5572	18153	244	54	1	2	2	3	If you think there shouldn't be a death penalty, you're an idiot.	Of those reasons which you gave, which ones do you think cannot be accomodated by lesser senteces and NEED the death penalty?
1	5572	28050	36	1	1	19	6	3	People have, and will, be executed even though they are innocent of the crime.	We shouldn't just kill someone if they commit a crime.
1	3065	4774	23	32	1	5	1	1	In fact, I think if Jesus did not believe in the death penalty, it would make his sacrifice that much greater, because he would be being unjustly put to death.	Although there is much controversy about him, I agree that prisons, especially for those for whom the death penalty could be considered, should be punishment.
3.666666667	4690	4756	44	33	1	0	0	1	"Well, since I believe in that there are crimes and criminals deserving of the death penalty, ""tookies"" execution served justice in my book."	Because we are all potential victims of violent crime, and I believe that there are violent crimes deserving of the death penalty.
4.333333333	17	8212	33	16	1	16	4	3	The death penalty is gives the ability to off killers and murderers, as, if they were given life in parole, they have the ability to escape and continue their crimes.	An argument for putting people to death is so that they can never escape and kill again.
1.333333333	823	3065	9	23	1	8	1	1	But I can't get past the fact that they'll be killed for killing someone else - it's hypocritical.	If someone were to torture and kill one of my kids, I don�۪t think killing them would be punishment enough.
3.333333333	4774	4774	58	44	1	3	14	1	jesus immediately agreed to them enforcing the death penalty, since the penalty for sin is death.	the death penalty is the consequence for sinning AND not accepting forgiveness.
1	25683	14127	15	60	3	5	30	3	You can attempt say I'm being illogical, but you have yet to explain why the death penalty is preferable to imprisonment.	There are many attempts to mitigate this risk, including revisions of the death penalty: but it is not, as you stated, eliminated.
3	5572	25683	39	7	1	0	5	3	The court time is not inevitable, otherwise there wouldn't be an argument as to the death penalty being more expensive than life imprisonment.	Actually, the idea that the death penalty costs more than lifetime imprisonment has been disproved many times.
4.666666667	373	5572	5	151	1	2	5	1	Life without parole lets you fix that mistake since they can be released if they are found innocent - not so with the death penalty.	If we sentence someone to life in prison, we can always free them at a later time if they are found to be innocent.
2.333333333	30812	3186	46	80	3	6	7	1	But killing someone because of him killing someone is quite hypocritical.	No one asks a murderer if killing a person for wearing pink feels like killing a person that has killed another... It may be equally as justified.
1	28050	8212	35	16	3	0	4	3	The death penalty is gives the ability to off killers and murderers, as, if they were given life in parole, they have the ability to escape and continue their crimes.	The death penalty is useless deterrent of crime because in the states that have them, they are not any more inclined to commit a crime because the threat of death penalty particularly if it is murder.
4	28050	13293	68	13	3	8	6	3	Back to reality, we convict the wrong person all the time, and we've set up a system where death penalty is actually more expensive than life in prison.	Not to mention that the death penalty is more costly than simple life in prison in both money and time.
1.333333333	1128	1128	50	40	1	0	0	1	I guess the question begs to be asked to my friends on the left is If life in prisonment is so much worse then the death penalty why do you think most prisoners on death row would choose that option?	If you get a life sentence, you shouldn't have any choices whatsoever.
1	25683	14127	67	60	3	0	22	3	You can't just assume the death penalty is a crime.	If you read my arguments clearly you would understand that i said capital punishment if used more often will deter crime.
1.333333333	30812	30812	108	48	3	0	1	3	For some people death penalty is better than life in prison, who are respect their freedom and who are consider that it is better to die than someone to judge them.

3	5572	14127	175	43	1	2	1	3	I do believe in the death Penalty, eye for and eye.	"So far, I am hearing ""an eye for an eye"" which is just that vengeance centered sense of justice that I am arguing against."
1	18153	17	17	64	3	0	5	1	There are a lot of people in jail for cold blooded murder, who did not get the death penalty.	Yes there should be a death penalty but it should only be used in extreme circumstances like treason, mass murder, ordering murders from within prison, and killing someone in prison.

3	2104	1676	66	49	1	1	2	1	IE - the death penalty acts as a deterrent to other would be murderers.	If capital punishment works (deterrent), why do we have such a high murder rate per capita?
4	5572	1128	188	40	1	0	0	1	I guess the question begs to be asked to my friends on the left is If life in prisonment is so much worse then the death penalty why do you think most prisoners on death row would choose that option?	I think that criminals view the death penalty as worse than life imprisonment and worse than temporary solitary confinement within life imprisonment - at least given the conditions in American prisons.
1.333333333	5572	30812	183	74	1	1	7	3	Like I said, I don't disagree with the theory of the death penalty.	"I suppose you could say ""well it keeps them from harming society"" but so does the death penalty."
1.333333333	5572	25683	200	7	1	11	27	3	There is no reason to give that person a death penalty.	The question with the death penalty is not kill or give no punishment.
1	7933	13526	56	22	1	1	0	3	You say that all people who commit gruesome murders are psychopaths.	Especially given that you have accepted that some innocent people are executed.
3	4756	2358	59	17	1	7	4	1	After we get through that, if he still retains the death penalty, it's a lot cheaper to kill him than to keep him up 'til he dies in prison.	Life incarceration will never let him kill again, and its cheaper.
1.333333333	25683	30812	89	22	3	25	3	3	The way I see it people who murder shouldn't be sentenced to death or spend life in the jails we have here there to nice.	The death penalty has not been shown to be more effective than life imprisonment in deterring murder, hence we should choose life imprisonment.
3.666666667	31664	13293	65	13	3	0	6	3	Back to reality, we convict the wrong person all the time, and we've set up a system where death penalty is actually more expensive than life in prison.	Actually we still kill the wrong person all the time.
2.333333333	25683	25683	81	7	3	0	27	3	There is no reason to give that person a death penalty.	Last time I checked, killing doesn't bring persons back to life, so the only reason for the death penalty seems to be revenge.
2	31664	15556	54	18	3	1	3	3	That should be a crime which should result in the death penalty.	The truth is that the Death Penalty punishes those who have convicted a crime of extreme severity, not any criminal who commits a crime.
2	5572	5572	230	261	1	1	4	1	I have a entirely different view as to what the goal of capital punishment should be.	Rehabilitation is one goal that one has for punishment but other goals might include:
1.333333333	13293	32206	16	20	3	0	3	3	You make it sound as though if someone is innocent, of anything, they should be killed.	I don't believe that they should because if you kill someone, they won't have the chance to either get rehabilitated nor will they have the chance to actually regret what they have done.
2	17	823	128	37	1	4	17	1	What we need are harsher sentences including the death penalty.	We need to halt the death penalty before anyone else gets unjustly sentenced, then fix the problems (if that is even possible), and then, when we have safeguards in place, reinstitute it.
2	4756	7933	96	57	1	1	2	1	One of the many grievances I have is that child rapists don't qualify for the death penalty unless the child that gets raped is also killed.	There are no children being killed, and killing a child is murder in America.
4.333333333	14510	8212	49	13	3	0	8	3	The right to take away another man's life is not in our hands and therefore, I think that the death penalty is morally incorrect.	I'm also against death penalty because no one except God has the right to take person's life.
1	7933	30812	314	22	1	2	3	3	The way I see it people who murder shouldn't be sentenced to death or spend life in the jails we have here there to nice.	Some innocent people are still sentenced to death, and that's where I see a problem.
1	14510	32744	64	41	3	1	6	3	I do not think that a government should be unable to kill someone, simply that they almost always should not.	When they are about to be shot just think what would be happening, some unlucky person would be dealing with the fact that they were going to have to take someone's life.
4.333333333	2104	2652	30	25	1	5	2	1	My argument is that innocent people have been killed by the death penalty.	So in reality, pushing the death penalty only ensures that more innocent people will be murdered.
2.666666667	28237	373	2	36	3	0	8	1	And especially why would one do that if it means death penalty would become possible?	The death penalty is the best possible deterrent for crime.
3.666666667	28050	4756	141	59	3	2	0	1	If one person was excecuted when he was innocent than thats hundreds too many.	Also, Texas has executed persons who were, in fact, innocent.
3.333333333	14510	4756	63	13	3	0	1	1	I support the death penalty because I feel that their are crimes and criminals so heinous that they deserve death.	that is why I support it for serial killers, I don't really support it for a murderer.
2	4690	36893	32	1	1	18	0	3	Yes, death penalty is not a qualified punishment for a crime.	The death penalty is simply a legally imposed punishment given to felons who commited crimes for which the death penalty is applicable.
3.666666667	14510	17	54	128	3	49	3	1	If we don't stop the death penalty before we try to fix it, the imperfect system will continue to convict innocent people while we determine what is best for it.	If we can not prevent the innocent from unjust punishment, we should not have the death penalty.
3.666666667	25683	25683	36	36	3	17	5	3	Additionally, the implementation of state moratoria is associated with the increased incidence of murders.	A removal from death row by either state courts or the U.S. Supreme Court is associated with an increase of one additional murder.
1	5572	30812	225	18	1	1	2	3	There have been about 111 people sentenced to death who were found guilty while waiting.	Many people find some crimes heinous enough to warrent the death penalty.
3	14510	1128	8	42	3	2	1	1	"And no one said that life in prision is ""much worse"" then the death penalty."	Firstly, life in prison is a worse punishment.Death penalty it is the simplest punishment for the person who e.g. killed, raped, committed act of terrorism and etc.
1	7933	1128	240	50	1	6	0	1	If you get a life sentence, you shouldn't have any choices whatsoever.	If you chose to kill someone who wasn't endangering your life at the moment you deserve to be killed.
3	4690	1676	12	35	1	0	4	1	Therefore the argument of death as a deterent is a joke.	SO in turn, there is no clear evidence indicating that there is not a detterent value to the death penalty.
2	33642	14127	1	91	3	1	6	3	"""by not killing those who deserve it""....do rape victims deserve it?"	You might say the criminal deserved it, but murder is murder, whether they deserved it or not.
1	5572	17	222	35	1	10	28	1	I fail to see how this proves that ���there is no question that Jesus was against the death penalty.�۝	Statistics show that capital punishment is no more of a deterrent than life without parole so I fail to see your arguement about society needing capital punishment.
3.333333333	5572	1128	184	42	1	3	1	1	"And no one said that life in prision is ""much worse"" then the death penalty."	People generally think that the death penalty is worse than life without parole (certainly most criminals seem to think so).
1	3065	30812	88	87	1	5	5	3	Too much racism in this country to have the death penalty.	abortion does not qualify as state murder like the death penalty.
1	7933	4690	265	47	1	3	0	1	If the same murderer had been given the death penalty, and never released in the first place, he would not be able to kill again.	So what does he have to do with a debate like this about murderers and the death penalty?
1	30812	28050	22	113	3	3	1	3	The people dying from the death penalty are guilty people who have taken the lives of others.	The way I see it people who murder shouldn't be sentenced to death or spend life in the jails we have here there to nice.
1	4690	4756	87	96	1	16	1	1	There are no children being killed, and killing a child is murder in America.	We could get the person who may kill in the future.
3.666666667	28050	31664	196	18	3	0	3	3	BUT it is not apparent that death penalty lower crime rate.	Most other first-world countries don't have the death penalty, but have lower rates of crime, just pointing that out.
1	33642	28050	1	99	3	1	2	3	You are probably going to murder somebody; hopefully it will b in a place with the death penalty and then you will get what you deserve.	You might say the criminal deserved it, but murder is murder, whether they deserved it or not.
1	6937	28050	24	216	1	1	1	3	It seems that you're assuming the correlation between crime rate and countries with capital punishment is that the death penalty encourages crime.	It seems that there is still a majority in this country who is for the death penalty.
1.333333333	28050	14127	203	79	3	18	4	3	the use of the death penalty is an act of revenge which cannot be undone, so should the state be put on trial for putting to death an innocent person?	The death penalty has been used as a scapegoat for many people who are against executions.
1	12024	30697	9	27	3	0	1	3	First, it is more expensive than sentencing someone to life in prison.	it has been proven time and again prisons don't rehabilitate, keeping someone in prision for their entire life in prision is less human than the death penalty.
4	20886	22346	3	13	3	4	0	3	The death penalty is an effective deterrent when used properly.	The death penalty has been found to be a more effective deterrent to crimes against children.
1	14127	4690	33	191	3	16	5	1	"You said something to the effect of ""should we really be giving this man the death penalty?"""	And hey, if you think man is just an animal, then the death penalty shouldn't matter to you since you can't say life has any intrinsic value (remember, you believe in relativity).
1.333333333	25683	5572	91	183	3	23	1	1	"I suppose you could say ""well it keeps them from harming society"" but so does the death penalty."	Quite a lot of people think that criminals should be punished for the sake of punishing them, whether or not it deters anyone; I had thought you were one of them.
3.333333333	5572	6937	248	33	1	7	2	1	Do you disagree, though, that it is mainly retribution that you are looking for in supporting the death penalty?	If you accept vengeance as a reason for punishment then I understand why you would support the death penalty.
1.666666667	28050	3186	66	95	3	0	26	1	I am pro-death penalty even though I conceed that every study I have seen suggests it does absolutely nothing to deter capitol crimes.	I think the death penalty is an archaic and obsolete form of punishment, even for the crime of murder.
1	17	5304	4	14	1	9	3	1	If it is not, then we should not be putting people on trial for murder.	what you are saying is that we should murder people because the prisons are overcrowded.
2	5572	5572	292	304	1	9	5	1	As far as someone killing while in prison, or escaping and killing innocents, I have addressed this too, and have stated that this is part of the reason I support the death penalty.	Deterrence is not the only reason I support the death penalty.
1	5572	25683	50	81	1	1	0	3	Last time I checked, killing doesn't bring persons back to life, so the only reason for the death penalty seems to be revenge.	The death penalty (because of appeals) costs more than solitary confinement for life, both of which would ensure that the person would never kill again.
1	30697	30812	7	114	3	2	0	3	life in jail is better than death penalty...at least they would get the chance to suffer longer...maybe that would give them a sense of what they did...or aware them of how life works.	For that I do not disagree, yes hundreds maybe thousands of people have either been sentenced to death or served a period of time in jail for a crime they did not commit.
3.666666667	22346	8212	25	17	3	38	0	3	The death penalty is usually given as a sentence in place of lifetime in a max security prison without parole.	In every state that retains the death penalty, jurors have the option of sentencing convicted capital murderers to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
2	17	7933	63	57	1	13	2	1	One of the many grievances I have is that child rapists don't qualify for the death penalty unless the child that gets raped is also killed.	I would rather have justice be done than to give a rapist the chance to grab another little girl or a murderer to have the chance to kill an innocent person I might know or care about.
1.666666667	1128	32206	23	20	1	2	3	3	You make it sound as though if someone is innocent, of anything, they should be killed.	If they don't want to kill an innocent person, stick to life in prison.
2.333333333	5572	30812	270	69	1	9	0	3	Again... there is nearly never a fail-safe, sending an innocent man to death isn't something you can take back.	After all, the person you're torturing may actually be innocent.
3.333333333	25683	32744	85	26	3	9	4	3	I feel as though you're implying that the death penalty is an effective crime deterrent.	Almost every study I've seen on the deterrent effect of the death penalty has suggested that it's no more effective than life imprisonment.
1	14127	25683	60	86	3	22	7	3	Lets assume that you are referring to the murder victims in prison, implementing the death penalty will help to ensure a level of discipline for those who continue to plot against others in prison or in the free society.	You can't just assume the death penalty is a crime.
4	5572	25683	222	35	1	10	0	3	Your description, that the death penalty is a deterrent, is incorrect.	Statistics show that capital punishment is no more of a deterrent than life without parole so I fail to see your arguement about society needing capital punishment.
1.333333333	14510	33045	20	90	3	5	0	3	I think that if the murderer wants the death penalty, they should be allowed it if the victim's family agrees- but for crimes of passion and misunderstanding, no death penalty.	Someone in my family, honestly I would want that person to take the death penalty.
1	18153	33045	39	35	3	0	4	3	The question is should the death penalty be allowed as a form of punishment.	The death penalty is a outdated, expensive, immoral, form of punishment.
4.333333333	5065	17	1	26	1	16	9	1	Roman law said she should be put to death, Jesus said no, that law is wrong.	Others have said that the death penalty is biblically wrong.
1	17	28050	134	99	1	4	2	3	You are probably going to murder somebody; hopefully it will b in a place with the death penalty and then you will get what you deserve.	By killing a person who murdered someone, you are just doing the same thing you are punishing him/her for.
1.333333333	6937	5572	5	186	1	6	15	1	In reality I wouldn't care if the death penalty were gone.	in fact the ones against the death penalty ARE FOR ABORTION!
2	4690	14510	54	11	1	1	1	3	There has been so much cases of people who have been executed, only to be found innocent after their death.	You need to find lots more for the death penalty to save more lives than innocents that have been executed by it.
1	25683	32744	50	21	3	1	1	3	I mean that if the death penalty would be legalized, people will scare to commit the crime.	I have evidence that says that innocent people are convicted of crimes.
1	18153	7933	52	250	3	2	0	1	No he the guy who killed twitter should have to suffer in jail and think about what he done for the rest of his life, and not be given the easy way out buy the death pentaly.	First it is more expensive to kill a person, then letting him stay for a life long imprisonment.
1.666666667	18153	18153	52	9	3	1	1	3	A life seems to be a good price for a serious enough crime.	There is not any good by taking the life of the criminal.
4	4690	25683	12	90	1	0	33	3	The death penalty again has not only shown but proved to deter murder so therefore i wpuld suggest you reconsider your closing arguments.	SO in turn, there is no clear evidence indicating that there is not a detterent value to the death penalty.
2.333333333	14127	15556	88	15	3	13	3	3	Some crimes are so heinous that the person who committed the crime deserves to die: I would only agree to this if the execution erased the crime that was committed in the first place.	by committing to the idea that someone deserves to die, you are committing to the revenge side of human nature, not the idea of punishment for crimes committed.
1.666666667	5572	4690	269	20	1	21	13	1	If the person in question is in prison, they are removed from society.	if one cannot be rehabiliated in prison, they should be eliminated.
1	4690	7933	78	265	1	3	3	1	So what does he have to do with a debate like this about murderers and the death penalty?	An argument regarding the death penalty should be confined to discussions regarding those who have been wrongly convicted and sentenced to death.
2.333333333	2104	28050	64	113	1	1	2	3	I have heard that there are false verdicts and that some innocent people are killed accidentally, but that number is decreasing year by year.	I'm not really in favor of killing innocent people either.
1	28050	28050	113	102	3	1	0	3	In fact mudkipz, many people would prefer the death penalty of life in jail.	The people dying from the death penalty are guilty people who have taken the lives of others.
3	20886	33045	1	86	3	1	2	3	Besides, if someone raped and killed my daughter, I'd prefer they suffered the rest of their life in jail being man-raped by a bunch of rednecks and neo-nazi's than just be given the easy way out.	If I were charged to do something that forced me to spend the rest of my life in jail, I would rather die right now - I think they're doing the criminal a favor by putting him down.
3	25683	28050	90	202	3	1	25	3	States without the death penalty have fared BETTER in reducing their murder rates than states with the death penalty.	The murder rate for the state of New York, a state without the death penalty has increased this year with a higher rate of murder than it was in 2009.
3	1128	5572	3	221	1	1	3	1	You can't get much worse than a death penalty.	Death is a much kinder sentence than life in prison, if you are sentenced to life, you should get to suffer for the whole bit.
3	5572	4774	186	58	1	14	5	1	its simply that the option exists to get around the death penalty.	No doubt there are other options besides the death penalty.
2.333333333	5065	4774	1	98	1	16	11	1	In any case, he didn't say that the penalty for sin is death, he said the penalty for one particular action which Adam couldn't even know was wrong, being unaware of good and evil, was death.	Others have said that the death penalty is biblically wrong.
3	14127	28237	79	8	3	6	7	3	Life imprisonment without parole is more effective than execution, and it is cheaper.	i think that life without opportunity of parole is the more humane and just punishment instead of the death penalty.
1.666666667	2652	2104	31	55	1	7	8	1	If we have a death penalty statute on the books, a person is convicted under that statute, his ONE appeal fails...he should die.	And that killer has help, he has the people that support the death penalty and will give him more appeals, and if found guilty he'll get an easy way out with death, he won't have to suffer.
1	3271	5572	52	183	1	8	1	1	"I suppose you could say ""well it keeps them from harming society"" but so does the death penalty."	I am responding.....you seem to think thatg life in prison is worse then the death penalty........I am telling you that the prisoners on death row would disagree........
3	373	4756	31	4	1	3	10	1	A perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people, and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty.	No matter how well the justice system works, we will always risk convicting innocent people.
2.666666667	14127	4690	50	44	3	1	0	1	Because we are all potential victims of violent crime, and I believe that there are violent crimes deserving of the death penalty.	I believe that people who have killed, raped, tortured, or have done any other extreme act of violence should get the death penalty.
3.666666667	33642	25683	20	91	3	1	23	3	Quite a lot of people think that criminals should be punished for the sake of punishing them, whether or not it deters anyone; I had thought you were one of them.	Criminals need to be punished for what they have done.
1.333333333	17	30812	33	108	1	16	0	3	I think instead of a death penalty, they should just stay in prison until they die because putting someone to death is just harsh, No matter who it is.	An argument for putting people to death is so that they can never escape and kill again.
2.333333333	14127	17	50	134	3	2	4	1	By killing a person who murdered someone, you are just doing the same thing you are punishing him/her for.	Whatever the offender did should have the same done to him/her.
2.333333333	1676	25683	47	83	1	1	3	3	If these bleak prospects aren't enough to deter someone from committing a serious crime, what will ramping it up to the death penalty do?	If a person is deterred from commiting a crime it is because fear in that person's mind has prevented him from commiting the crime.
1	9676	32206	21	20	1	1	3	3	You make it sound as though if someone is innocent, of anything, they should be killed.	You cannot kill somebody just because they've broken into your house, you have to have a well founded fear of harm.
1	4774	30697	100	19	1	0	0	3	The dealth penalty is not as simple as it seems.	it seems as though your concept of ideal justice necessitates punishment immediately.
2.666666667	31664	28050	18	216	3	3	1	3	It seems that you're assuming the correlation between crime rate and countries with capital punishment is that the death penalty encourages crime.	BUT it is not apparent that death penalty lower crime rate.
3.333333333	28050	1676	70	16	3	1	6	1	I think it could be proven that putting somebody in prison for life whent ehy have requested the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment.	That could be considered Cruel and Unusual Punishment, it could mess with the persons mind.
1.666666667	8212	1128	17	42	3	0	1	1	"And no one said that life in prision is ""much worse"" then the death penalty."	The death penalty is usually given as a sentence in place of lifetime in a max security prison without parole.
1.333333333	7836	5572	19	263	3	0	6	1	Either do that or do away with the law that says that death is the proper penalty to pay for the crime.	"There cannot be a ""no"" answer since the death penalty is already legal."
4.333333333	32744	3065	24	23	3	8	1	1	But I can't get past the fact that they'll be killed for killing someone else - it's hypocritical.	Killing a person for them killing someone else ( I understand this is not necessarily the criteria for receiving the death penalty) makes you no better than the executed.
3.333333333	1676	3065	59	8	1	6	2	1	The deterrent of the death penalty cannot be directed at the executed, but does put fear in the minds of other potential capital criminals.	The death penalty is not deterrance for the person executed.
1.666666667	28050	32744	64	6	3	0	0	3	we should have death penalty only for the most severe criminally insane serial killers.	If we continue to allow the death penalty, we are no better than the murderers and rapists that we punish with the death penalty.
2.666666667	33045	22346	72	7	3	1	1	3	And the purpose of the death penalty is not to punish, but to deter further crime.	There is no crime which justifies others to kill as a form of punishment, and it is ineffective as a deterrent to prevent crime.
4	2104	28050	66	210	1	1	0	3	If the death penalty deters murder (as you claim) then why does Europe have a lower murder rate even though they've outlawed the death penalty?	If capital punishment works (deterrent), why do we have such a high murder rate per capita?
5	6937	25683	31	97	1	0	2	3	The problem with capital punishment, however, is that it is permanent.	My major complaint against the death penalty is that it is quite permanent.
3	3065	7933	52	252	1	0	2	1	I am not a pacifist, so I am not opposed to all state-sanctioned killing.	I am very conservative and I am opposed to abortion and the death penalty.
1.333333333	14127	33045	79	63	3	4	3	3	If you support the death penalty and concede that an innocent man could be put to death, you must be willing to put your name in the hat, with every one else, to have the government execute you by mistake.	the use of the death penalty is an act of revenge which cannot be undone, so should the state be put on trial for putting to death an innocent person?
1.666666667	8200	3186	20	21	3	0	3	1	I cannot compare numbers with other western countries since we are the only one with capital punishment.	I think the death penalty is one of the several punishment in the law system, we shouldn't consider it like something insane, and moreover it's normal in some countries nowadays.
1.333333333	5572	8200	304	11	1	5	0	3	If there was no justifiable reason for the murder then I don't care who kills the bastard... the state or a civilian.	As far as someone killing while in prison, or escaping and killing innocents, I have addressed this too, and have stated that this is part of the reason I support the death penalty.
2	5572	4690	265	47	1	0	3	1	If we fail to execute murderers, and doing so would in fact have deterred other murders, we have allowed the killing of a bunch of innocent victims.	So how about we stop a penalty that has executed innocents?
1	5572	17	50	136	1	26	1	1	So we kill killers, but in the end, end up with more murders.	If it is as serious as torture or murder... Yes we should.
1.333333333	28050	31664	113	39	3	1	1	3	What if there were people killing other people, escaping from jail, doing it again etc.	The people dying from the death penalty are guilty people who have taken the lives of others.
2.666666667	1128	1128	5	31	1	0	1	1	Anyway, with that I would actually favor allowing criminals to choose death as long as they choose death with no appeals.	"I am ""for"" capital punishment... but if a criminal shows a desire for death over a life sentence, I prefer to be sadistic."
4.666666667	30812	30812	111	92	3	0	1	3	but spending whole life in jail would be a better punishment	I think people suffer more when they spend their whole lives in jail.
1.333333333	5572	18153	188	41	1	13	0	3	Well I, as creator of this debate, think that there should not be a death penalty.	I don't feel as strongly about the death penalty as I feel about the abortion rights debate since I can relate to the desire for vengeance that people feel.
3.666666667	28050	4690	84	59	3	12	12	1	I will agree that the death penalty is too arbitrarily applied.	I dont think the death penalty should be apllied in just any case.
4.666666667	17	17	128	121	1	3	3	1	By the same token, if we keep administering the death penalty while the system is broken, we will have a much greater risk of putting someone innocent to death.	If we don't stop the death penalty before we try to fix it, the imperfect system will continue to convict innocent people while we determine what is best for it.
2.666666667	30812	7933	16	57	3	14	2	1	One of the many grievances I have is that child rapists don't qualify for the death penalty unless the child that gets raped is also killed.	If you raped and killed my kids, I would not want you to be executed.
2.333333333	28050	22346	7	25	3	1	34	3	In many cases, the appointed attorneys are overworked, underpaid, or lacking the trial experience required for death penalty cases.	Everything that is needed for an ordinary trial is the same for a Death Penalty case, only more so.
4.333333333	5572	25683	140	35	1	0	0	3	Your description, that the death penalty is a deterrent, is incorrect.	The argument for the death penalty as a deterrent has been proved wrong by the implementation of it through history.
1.333333333	20886	31664	4	39	3	1	1	3	What if there were people killing other people, escaping from jail, doing it again etc.	The government does not have the right to kill people.
2.333333333	5572	17	263	84	1	7	0	1	Even if the death penalty is beneficial to society is it alright to sacrifice the lives of a few innocent people for the public good?	The few cases that convict innocent people are becoming even fewer.
1	33642	5572	37	145	3	4	9	1	As far as the deterrent argument, I have said this before, and I will say it again: There is no accurate way to measure if the death penalty is deterring crime or not.	If these are indeed comparable, I wouldn't argue for the death penalty even in murder.
2	4690	17	47	136	1	3	1	1	So we kill killers, but in the end, end up with more murders.	If we fail to execute murderers, and doing so would in fact have deterred other murders, we have allowed the killing of a bunch of innocent victims.
3.333333333	5572	1128	221	40	1	3	0	1	I guess the question begs to be asked to my friends on the left is If life in prisonment is so much worse then the death penalty why do you think most prisoners on death row would choose that option?	You can't get much worse than a death penalty.
1.666666667	5572	3065	36	23	1	27	2	1	I say if someone gets life w/o parole, they should be put into a real jail, rather than the country clubs many criminals go to.	I say if they try to kill/escape from life w/o parole in prison that's all we should need for the death penalty.
2.333333333	30812	13175	108	18	3	0	3	3	If a person just raped someone (this is just an example) they shouldn't be killed for it, but something like a mass murdering or serial killing should be dealt with by putting them to death.	I think instead of a death penalty, they should just stay in prison until they die because putting someone to death is just harsh, No matter who it is.
1	6937	8212	5	4	1	6	0	3	The death penalty has a foundation in justice and it spares more innocent lives.	in fact the ones against the death penalty ARE FOR ABORTION!
1.666666667	1676	25683	78	110	1	12	0	3	I see no point in letting someone live who does not want to live, or letting someone die who does not want to die.	If someone killed my relative, I wouldn't want them killed, I would want them to spend the rest of their lives in hard, back breaking labor.
3	4690	28050	88	216	1	5	1	3	It seems that you're assuming the correlation between crime rate and countries with capital punishment is that the death penalty encourages crime.	I'm pretty sure that the states with the death penalty do NOT have better crime rates or even better capital crime rates.
1.333333333	6937	30812	24	87	1	1	5	3	Too much racism in this country to have the death penalty.	It seems that there is still a majority in this country who is for the death penalty.
1.333333333	4690	4774	78	53	1	3	9	1	As it is today, when someone murderers another, the death penalty is considered, as it should be.	An argument regarding the death penalty should be confined to discussions regarding those who have been wrongly convicted and sentenced to death.
4	5572	31664	266	52	1	7	6	3	As long as we sentence people to a life in prison we are also GUARANTEED to sentence an innocent person.	Given the scrutiny of death penalty cases, it seems that we would be more likely to lock someone up for life in prison and never uncover their innocence than we are to execute an innocent person.
4.333333333	3065	5572	76	248	1	2	3	1	So, the question remains, why kill them if you don't need to.	But why do you have to get rid of them by killing them.
1.333333333	17	823	131	37	1	3	17	1	What we need are harsher sentences including the death penalty.	If we execute death penalty, we will not be better than murderers.
1.666666667	8212	8212	13	3	3	0	1	3	The death penalty is just such a sanction when considering the worste of all crimes.	The death penalty can be viewed as legalized murder, which is ironic considering that such a punishment is only imposed because of the cruelty of the crime - murder.
1	31664	17	65	64	3	0	2	1	If someone keeps killing and killing and killing, we need to stop him from taking lives.	Actually we still kill the wrong person all the time.
1.666666667	28050	5572	45	70	3	0	0	1	The person who said that the death penalty should be used for people who are convicted of multiple-burglaries sounds like a complete knucklehead.	The death penalty is not used for what it is supposed to be used for.
1.333333333	5572	4774	263	13	1	5	1	1	The death penalty executes felons found guilty of especially heinous crimes.	The person having been convicted of a crime punishable by death and subsequently sentenced to death should be put to death.
1.666666667	18153	4690	11	115	3	0	0	1	With all this talk about innocent people being put to death, I was wondering.	I think there should be a death penalty because, all those innocent people getting killed for no damn reason is unfair.
1	25683	4756	28	62	3	1	49	1	Essentially, you believe a fetus should be allowed to be killed simply for existing, while you protect the lives of people who have murdered other innocent people (as murder is generally what a person will get the death penalty for).	"Serial killers, ""How many people did you kill?"""
1	15556	2104	14	16	3	3	3	1	People who will commit a crime with life in prison would probably still commit the crime with capital punishment.	The death penalty is about specific crimes, not any crimes.
2.666666667	25683	14510	89	37	3	25	13	3	A life sentence does not prevent a murderer from murdering again.	The death penalty has not been shown to be more effective than life imprisonment in deterring murder, hence we should choose life imprisonment.
1	17	5304	128	14	1	1	3	1	If it is not, then we should not be putting people on trial for murder.	If we don't stop the death penalty now, we will put innocent people to death while we try to fix the problems.
3	30812	30812	48	114	3	1	0	3	life in jail is better than death penalty...at least they would get the chance to suffer longer...maybe that would give them a sense of what they did...or aware them of how life works.	For some people death penalty is better than life in prison, who are respect their freedom and who are consider that it is better to die than someone to judge them.
5	33642	33642	20	21	3	1	0	3	I am not disagreeing with punishing criminals for crimes they have committed.	Criminals need to be punished for what they have done.
3.333333333	20886	31664	3	27	3	4	3	3	The thing is, without the death penalty there is absolutely no deterrent from committing heinous crimes.	The death penalty has been found to be a more effective deterrent to crimes against children.
1.333333333	14127	17	74	136	3	3	1	1	So we kill killers, but in the end, end up with more murders.	At the end of the day the killer is being punished for ending a life.
2.666666667	5572	823	266	36	1	7	34	1	We should not even have the death penalty just on the off chance that we might execute somebody who is innocent.	Given the scrutiny of death penalty cases, it seems that we would be more likely to lock someone up for life in prison and never uncover their innocence than we are to execute an innocent person.
1	5304	4690	6	18	1	1	5	1	It is called the death penalty for a reason...it is a penalty, a punishment.	In all cases, the first punishment shouldn't be the death penalty.
2	4690	1128	199	3	1	7	1	1	Death is a much kinder sentence than life in prison, if you are sentenced to life, you should get to suffer for the whole bit.	In both cases you spend the rest of your life in jail and die there.
2.333333333	31664	28050	30	169	3	1	0	3	I say kill 'em, they're a waste of the federal budget.	I say that they should be killed the same way that the person(s) that they killed were.
1	14510	5572	64	256	3	1	13	1	If they know they'll die if caught, they'll likely kill more rape victims and children.	When they are about to be shot just think what would be happening, some unlucky person would be dealing with the fact that they were going to have to take someone's life.
1	2652	17	31	25	1	7	5	1	And because Christ forgave the men that unjustly killed him does not conclusivly show that He was against the death penalty.	And that killer has help, he has the people that support the death penalty and will give him more appeals, and if found guilty he'll get an easy way out with death, he won't have to suffer.
1.333333333	3065	25683	74	97	1	0	2	3	The problem with capital punishment, however, is that it is permanent.	The question of the death penalty is a tricky issue.
2.666666667	373	7933	19	334	1	1	0	1	That's true, but I think the natural response to that would be that knowing the death penalty might be applied jurors would be much more careful about the burden of proof.	I think the death penalty should only be used when there is undeniable proof against the suspect.
3.666666667	4756	4756	68	13	1	18	1	1	I support the death penalty because I feel that their are crimes and criminals so heinous that they deserve death.	They support it because killing murderers is the right thing to do.
1.333333333	7933	33045	31	68	1	3	3	3	Death penalty should be allowed for those who deserves it.	No, the death penalty is society as a whole voting that someone is far too dangerous to be allowed to remain in the country and deserves to be removed.
1.333333333	28050	14127	114	50	3	1	1	3	I believe that people who have killed, raped, tortured, or have done any other extreme act of violence should get the death penalty.	I agree that the people who are killed are mostly innocent people and that those killed by the death penalty are almost certainly guilty of the crime.
1	22346	36893	25	31	3	0	5	3	All of this information is the reason the Death penalty is so costly.	There are many reasons the death penalty should be abolished.
1	5572	4690	200	47	1	11	0	1	If the same murderer had been given the death penalty, and never released in the first place, he would not be able to kill again.	The question with the death penalty is not kill or give no punishment.
4	28237	373	2	2	3	0	5	1	If we slap a guarantueed death penalty on murder then any following murderer commits the crime on pain of death which is a much better detterent.	The death penalty is the best possible deterrent for crime.
1.333333333	5572	14510	304	63	1	5	0	3	that is why I support it for serial killers, I don't really support it for a murderer.	As far as someone killing while in prison, or escaping and killing innocents, I have addressed this too, and have stated that this is part of the reason I support the death penalty.
3	28050	30697	35	17	3	0	0	3	Death penalty should be allowed as it deters people from committing serious crimes such as murder.	The death penalty is useless deterrent of crime because in the states that have them, they are not any more inclined to commit a crime because the threat of death penalty particularly if it is murder.
2	22346	28050	25	207	3	0	8	3	If we are talking about abolishing the death penalty, then what is the point in arguing against technology that can only become more advanced?	There are many reasons the death penalty should be abolished.
1	823	823	1	9	1	6	1	1	If that is the case I am against Capital Punishment.	Personally I am more interested in the deterrent effect of capital punishment over the punishment aspect.
1.333333333	7933	1676	265	26	1	3	2	1	The death of a criminal prevents him from committing any further crimes.	So what does he have to do with a debate like this about murderers and the death penalty?
4.666666667	3065	1676	5	26	1	5	2	1	The death of a criminal prevents him from committing any further crimes.	Well one thing for sure the muderer or rapist who is executed will never commit those crimes again........He is permanently deterred........
3	7933	17	240	3	1	6	0	1	If you are ready to take somebody elses life, you'd better be prepared to give your life as well.	If you chose to kill someone who wasn't endangering your life at the moment you deserve to be killed.
1	4690	4690	87	149	1	16	7	1	We seem to have more compassion for the victims and potential victims of murderers than we do for the murderers.	We could get the person who may kill in the future.
1	17	5065	130	1	1	1	5	1	When a person commits a crime, the Judicial system is responsible for determining a proportional response or penalty for the crime.	There is no way to determine how many murders would have been committed.
3.666666667	31664	8212	40	13	3	0	8	3	The right to take away another man's life is not in our hands and therefore, I think that the death penalty is morally incorrect.	Death penatly is not just about money, but it is morally wrong.
2.333333333	2104	5572	51	302	1	5	0	1	So, in summary, you aren't against the death penalty on principle.	If you're arguing for a general principle (eg that Capital punishment is acceptible and effective) then you have to argue in the general case:
1	5572	30812	292	93	1	9	0	3	For sheer purposes of punishing a criminal, I don't support the death penalty.	Deterrence is not the only reason I support the death penalty.
4	5572	5572	38	36	1	4	27	1	I say if they try to kill/escape from life w/o parole in prison that's all we should need for the death penalty.	You should also note that the one scenario I think the death penalty is acceptable for is if they try to escape using violence or if they attack another prisoner.
1	31664	31664	25	25	3	0	3	3	I don't think anyone has been put the death for third degree murder either.	I believe that murder is the killing of a human being.
5	7933	7933	31	31	1	9	7	1	If you rape a child then you deserve more than anybody to be put down and eliminated forever.	If you rape a kid then you shouldn't be allowed to live.
1	28050	7933	64	255	3	3	2	1	As for the death penalty, although it should be used more often on murders and serial killers, even rapists, it probaly isnt neccary to use it on robbers.	The death sentence has been used since the beginning of the United States, and rarely, if ever, has there been an occurrence in which someone avenges the death of a murderer or rapist.
2	5572	7933	304	252	1	5	2	1	I am not a pacifist, so I am not opposed to all state-sanctioned killing.	As far as someone killing while in prison, or escaping and killing innocents, I have addressed this too, and have stated that this is part of the reason I support the death penalty.
1	25683	1676	11	21	3	1	21	1	With all that it has been a very trying time for me and I have had to struggle with how I really felt about the death penalty.	I do feel that those who murder in cold blood would be more than deserving of the death penalty.
2.333333333	28050	20886	68	23	3	8	3	3	Hellno is right, capital punishment should be much more cost effective than the alternative- life in prison without parole.	Not to mention that the death penalty is more costly than simple life in prison in both money and time.
2.333333333	9676	28050	24	30	1	2	1	3	What you are actually criticizing is the success of a free appeals system and saying that it would have been better to kill an innocent man because that would have been cheaper and made a better point.	You think that just because an innocent man is set free after having had to go through the gauntlet the system works?
2	5572	28050	271	116	1	16	0	3	Why would you prefer people to be killed rather than jailed away from society so that their harm is neutralised?	And some people should be thrown away without being executed.
1.666666667	4690	2652	42	30	1	3	9	1	All of the death penalty oppontents are for life in jail as opposed to the death penalty.I am sure that if some are found innocent,there are at least that many that are innocent and never set free.	"The lives saved by the death penalty, which I suspect is 0, unless the answer to the above question is ""yes"", is smaller than the innocents killed by the death penalty."
1.333333333	22346	13526	17	25	3	0	1	3	I personally would never wish death penalty on someone no matter what they did to me/family/friends I would just want them in jail for a life sentence because then the threat is pretty much over.	Like I said I would just want them to actually have to deal with the consequences and not get an easy out, which is what executing them does.
1.666666667	5572	4756	45	5	1	3	3	1	My argument makes it clear that innocent people need not be sentenced to death in order for the death penalty to be unjust.	DNA technology could be required for the death penalty making it far less likely that an innocent is sentenced to death.
1.666666667	5572	7739	261	15	1	4	7	1	Unless you feel that punishment should be based solely on retribution, I think there is some wiggle room for different sentencing guidelines for different aged humans.	I have a entirely different view as to what the goal of capital punishment should be.
2.333333333	14127	32744	94	10	3	5	3	3	How can you justify teaching a generation of children that to stop killers from killing because killing is wrong, we should kill them?	As a whole has been decided that murder, that killing someone without a justifiable reason, is wrong.
3	6937	3186	5	61	1	6	65	1	I'm against abortion and nominally for the death penalty.	in fact the ones against the death penalty ARE FOR ABORTION!
5	5572	5572	255	255	1	5	7	1	It seems that those that would be deterred by fear of punishment are already dettered by the threat of a life sentence.	But the statistics don't support the idea that the death penalty is any more effective as a detterent than is a life sentence.
1.333333333	14127	33045	49	75	3	4	2	3	Once the danger is gone killing a person is simply murder.	Most people would agree that someone who kills someone in self defense doesn't deserve the death penalty, but there have been a couple of recent cases where someone killed someone in revenge for molesting their children.
1.333333333	4690	28050	185	209	1	39	16	3	Arguments that support the death penalty are the only ones that can reference the Constitution.	Those are the only relevant ones, seeing as my argument is that the death penalty should be changed to life imprisonment.
1	7933	31664	292	27	1	9	6	3	It wouldn't shock me if someone committed murder JUST to get those things.	I don't care if it is in the name of justice or if someone just wants to avenge a death, murder is murder, no matter how it is done.
1	30697	13293	19	12	3	0	2	3	No one who committed such an act should get the easy way out with death.	The dealth penalty is not as simple as it seems.
4	7933	5572	2	248	1	5	9	1	Otherwise, if it is only a matter that you don't want to pay for them, then I should mention that the average capital punishment criminal costs more all together than does a lifer.	The biggest problem I have with the death penalty is the cost.
1	6937	823	80	16	1	10	10	1	It is also possible for an innocent person to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, but nobody is making the argument to stop sending people to prison.	Prison guards, other inmates, etc., are all potential victims of lifers behind bars.
1.333333333	4690	5065	78	1	1	3	31	1	The final argument against the death penalty is that it is inhumane.	An argument regarding the death penalty should be confined to discussions regarding those who have been wrongly convicted and sentenced to death.
3.333333333	5572	7933	255	11	1	5	19	1	The statistics about the effectiveness of the death penalty in deterring crimes are very mixed and seem inconclusive.	But the statistics don't support the idea that the death penalty is any more effective as a detterent than is a life sentence.
2.666666667	5572	4756	177	5	1	5	3	1	My argument makes it clear that innocent people need not be sentenced to death in order for the death penalty to be unjust.	Anyway, the risk of killing an innocent is one arguement against the death penalty.
1.333333333	3186	17	42	33	1	6	16	1	An argument for putting people to death is so that they can never escape and kill again.	Or you could merely ignore them and concede that the death penalty is flawed, kills innocent people and costs the lives of innocents in the use of how it is funded
1	12024	4690	14	99	3	0	0	1	Acutally, long ago, the executioner was a convict also sentenced to death.	The problem with the death penalty is eventually someone will be sentenced to death when they are in fact guilty.
1.666666667	823	7933	13	12	1	0	11	1	Although, personally, I would rather be executed if I was innocent than sit in a cell for life.	I have heard of two instances of innocent men who were executed back in the seventies.
5	28050	28050	37	200	3	22	0	3	There is absolutely ZERO evidence that the death penalty deters crime.	In addition, it is evident that the death penalty does not deter murder rates.
1.333333333	823	17	37	127	1	17	1	1	The death penalty by nature requires a PERFECT body to govern it, we will never obtain that, we'll never come close.	What we need are harsher sentences including the death penalty.
1	3065	32744	107	21	1	0	1	3	I mean that if the death penalty would be legalized, people will scare to commit the crime.	I am a case by case pro, Some people simply need to be put to death for the crimes they have commited so that others are protected.
1.333333333	13526	5572	25	248	3	1	9	1	Otherwise, if it is only a matter that you don't want to pay for them, then I should mention that the average capital punishment criminal costs more all together than does a lifer.	I personally would never wish death penalty on someone no matter what they did to me/family/friends I would just want them in jail for a life sentence because then the threat is pretty much over.
1	5572	4690	70	43	1	0	11	1	When someone mentions a criminal deterrence factor with death sentences, it sounds like a bad joke or total ignorance.	The person who said that the death penalty should be used for people who are convicted of multiple-burglaries sounds like a complete knucklehead.
4.333333333	6937	5572	28	248	1	1	7	1	If you accept vengeance as a reason for punishment then I understand why you would support the death penalty.	The reasons given most often for supporting the death penalty are emotional reasons of retribution for the heinous acts of the criminal.
3.333333333	7933	14127	11	88	1	21	10	3	studies show that the death penalty is not a deterrent (which is one half of the reason for it's use) and murder rates are actually higher in states that have the death penalty (http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/deterrence-states-without-death-penalty-                                       have-had-consistently-lower-murder-rates#stateswithvwithout).	Unless there can be solid uncontestable evidence shown that the death penalty is significant in deterring crime, this cannot be used as an argument for the death penalty.
1.333333333	18153	4774	22	15	3	10	0	1	You could just as easily argue that he was unjustly put to death and therefore it is a statement against the death penalty.	Should the abuser be put to death, that would be to good for him.
1	3065	7933	23	207	1	5	17	1	Also, I wonder if a criminal thinks of the punishment when he commits the crime - if he were counting on being punished, he wouldn't have done it.	Although there is much controversy about him, I agree that prisons, especially for those for whom the death penalty could be considered, should be punishment.
1.666666667	18153	17	17	134	3	0	2	1	killing a person, no matter the reason, is still murder.	Yes there should be a death penalty but it should only be used in extreme circumstances like treason, mass murder, ordering murders from within prison, and killing someone in prison.
5	3065	5572	74	248	1	16	7	1	If you accept vengeance as a reason for punishment then I understand why you would support the death penalty.	So, the only reason I can really see why people support the death penalty is to have simple vengeance against the perpretrator.
2	5572	17	97	136	1	2	1	1	So we kill killers, but in the end, end up with more murders.	We let killers out of prison so they can kill again.
5	5572	4756	136	35	1	2	7	1	I firmly believe that some crimes and criminals are deserving of death.	I believe there are certain crimes where the death penalty is an acceptable punishment.
1	2652	5572	10	39	1	1	14	1	Only if they try to murder somebody after they are in prison do they deserve the death penalty?	If a person wasn't convicted then they surely wouldn't be murdered by the state.
1.333333333	7933	4690	265	4	1	3	0	1	Ask the family members of who he killed if he deserves death.	So what does he have to do with a debate like this about murderers and the death penalty?
3.666666667	4690	28050	152	1	1	2	6	3	People have, and will, be executed even though they are innocent of the crime.	Even the people who did the study saying that innocents had been executed admitted that they cannot prove same.
4.333333333	25683	3186	85	95	3	9	26	1	I am pro-death penalty even though I conceed that every study I have seen suggests it does absolutely nothing to deter capitol crimes.	Almost every study I've seen on the deterrent effect of the death penalty has suggested that it's no more effective than life imprisonment.
1	32744	14127	26	60	3	4	22	3	You can't just assume the death penalty is a crime.	I feel as though you're implying that the death penalty is an effective crime deterrent.
3.333333333	25683	14127	67	36	3	0	15	3	That comment implies that you see the death penalty as a deterrent.	If you read my arguments clearly you would understand that i said capital punishment if used more often will deter crime.
2	33045	33045	35	68	3	4	3	3	Death penalty should be allowed for those who deserves it.	The question is should the death penalty be allowed as a form of punishment.
1	25683	4690	28	119	3	1	3	1	Hitler killed a whole race, you are basically saying you don't mind if we kill a bunch of innocent people as long as we get guilty people as well.	"Serial killers, ""How many people did you kill?"""
5	14127	32744	36	26	3	15	4	3	I feel as though you're implying that the death penalty is an effective crime deterrent.	That comment implies that you see the death penalty as a deterrent.
1.333333333	14127	18153	36	54	3	15	2	3	If you think there shouldn't be a death penalty, you're an idiot.	That comment implies that you see the death penalty as a deterrent.
1.333333333	17	3065	63	67	1	13	0	1	How do you compare killing a little child who has never had the chance to live to the execution of a criminal who has been raping and killing little children?	I would rather have justice be done than to give a rapist the chance to grab another little girl or a murderer to have the chance to kill an innocent person I might know or care about.
1.333333333	1676	13293	78	8	1	12	3	3	I'm not saying that a child's life is worth more than an adults, I'm saying if they killed any one they forfeit their life, because they in return lose what they took from someone else.	If someone killed my relative, I wouldn't want them killed, I would want them to spend the rest of their lives in hard, back breaking labor.
5	14510	28050	49	42	3	0	0	3	I think America should ban the death penalty because no man/woman has the right to kill anyone even if the have done something wrong, because i believe that only God should have the power to take people's lives.	I'm also against death penalty because no one except God has the right to take person's life.
3	7933	14510	25	55	1	6	1	3	If someone kills my child, my parent, my siblings, my love, i would want them to pay the price.	I think I could kill someone trying to kill any one of my children.
2	32744	30812	10	83	3	3	2	3	>>>If we are sure they raped & killed those innocent children then we should let them die.	How can you justify teaching a generation of children that to stop killers from killing because killing is wrong, we should kill them?
4.666666667	18153	28050	39	66	3	0	0	3	I think the death penalty is an archaic and obsolete form of punishment, even for the crime of murder.	The death penalty is a outdated, expensive, immoral, form of punishment.
5	5572	5572	188	255	1	2	6	1	Indeed, the states with the death penalty on average have a higher per capita murder rate than those without - suggesting that other factors (economy, etc.) play a much larger role.	Indeed, on average, states with the death penalty have more murders per capita - probably because local economy is a higher differentiating influence.
1.333333333	14510	15556	49	12	3	0	2	3	So I think it is better to imprison those who deserve death for life, rather than even once as a people murder the wrong person.	I'm also against death penalty because no one except God has the right to take person's life.
1.333333333	15556	5572	14	263	3	3	6	1	Either do that or do away with the law that says that death is the proper penalty to pay for the crime.	The death penalty is about specific crimes, not any crimes.
4	28237	31664	10	56	3	10	14	3	In the United States, states without the death penalty has consistently lower murder rates.	The first twenty states with higher murder rates all have the death penalty.
3.333333333	1676	5572	35	287	1	4	2	1	Many people argue that the death penalty is not a detterence.	Therefore the argument of death as a deterent is a joke.
1.333333333	17	6937	32	36	1	24	1	1	Murder is murder and those who execute the death penalty are murderers as well.	Capitol punishment is not just the execution of murderers, but the execution of anyone by the state.
1.333333333	31664	13175	46	18	3	0	3	3	If a person just raped someone (this is just an example) they shouldn't be killed for it, but something like a mass murdering or serial killing should be dealt with by putting them to death.	One way that would make me happy with the death penalty is if the person was killed in the same way as the person that they murdered.
2.666666667	17	28050	124	203	1	0	0	3	"""We know for a FACT that innocent people have been put to death already""- then give me their names."	I would support the death penalty IF there was a way to ensure that it would not put innocent people to death.
1	32744	7933	35	56	3	0	1	1	Especially given that you have accepted that some innocent people are executed.	So, if you had to kill 1 person to save 2 people's lives...you wouldn't????
1	28050	12024	178	1	3	0	1	3	I don't think everyone should be put to death.	The death penalty right now is to easy even I think.

2.333333333	6937	28050	32	1	1	2	6	3	People have, and will, be executed even though they are innocent of the crime.	Obviously, if someone were found innocent before execution, they would not be executed.

1	31664	373	46	11	3	0	1	1	Capital punishment is killing someone as a punishment for a crime they committed.	One way that would make me happy with the death penalty is if the person was killed in the same way as the person that they murdered.
3	5065	14127	1	85	1	16	4	3	Yeah, including the human judgment that says that the death penalty is wrong.	Others have said that the death penalty is biblically wrong.
1.333333333	14127	9872	60	23	3	27	15	1	Is it reason to do away with the death penalty?	Saying the death penalty is a justified method of punishment for a crime just because the criminal is a killer himself is a completely contrived reason.
2	31664	30812	27	36	3	3	0	3	Death penalty are given to those who have comitted a very serious crime.	The thing is, without the death penalty there is absolutely no deterrent from committing heinous crimes.
3.666666667	4690	3065	88	93	1	3	2	1	Over 40 countries have abolished the death penalty for all crimes since 1990.	Only some states use the death penalty, only some countries allow the death penalty.
5	4756	28237	59	8	1	7	7	3	Life imprisonment without parole is more effective than execution, and it is cheaper.	Life incarceration will never let him kill again, and its cheaper.
1	7933	31664	62	27	1	7	6	3	It wouldn't shock me if someone committed murder JUST to get those things.	I have been a victim of rape and if I were a victim of murder I would not desire the death penalty for the perpetrator.
3	2104	28237	34	10	1	0	9	3	Since murder is viewed as wrong, it generally makes more sense to eliminate the death penalty because murder rates are generally lower in those states.	There are many countries with lower murder rates than the U.S. and no death penalty.
2.333333333	30697	2104	17	16	3	0	3	1	People who will commit a crime with life in prison would probably still commit the crime with capital punishment.	Death penalty should be allowed as it deters people from committing serious crimes such as murder.
1.333333333	7933	7933	292	62	1	9	7	1	I have been a victim of rape and if I were a victim of murder I would not desire the death penalty for the perpetrator.	I don't care if it is in the name of justice or if someone just wants to avenge a death, murder is murder, no matter how it is done.
2	22346	1676	7	26	3	1	2	1	The death of a criminal prevents him from committing any further crimes.	And the purpose of the death penalty is not to punish, but to deter further crime.
4	30812	20886	111	1	3	0	1	3	If I were charged to do something that forced me to spend the rest of my life in jail, I would rather die right now - I think they're doing the criminal a favor by putting him down.	I think people suffer more when they spend their whole lives in jail.
3.666666667	28050	28050	196	215	3	0	2	3	Also, within the USA, murder rates are consistently lower in states that don't have capital punishment.	Most other first-world countries don't have the death penalty, but have lower rates of crime, just pointing that out.
1	28050	14127	105	50	3	1	1	3	I believe that people who have killed, raped, tortured, or have done any other extreme act of violence should get the death penalty.	, I believe the death penalty has deterred at least some people from committing murder.
4.333333333	30697	30697	19	27	3	2	1	3	First, it is more expensive than sentencing someone to life in prison.	The fact remains that life in prison is cheaper than sentencing one to the death penalty.
1	17	30812	130	36	1	1	0	3	Death penalty are given to those who have comitted a very serious crime.	There is no way to determine how many murders would have been committed.
1	7933	4756	56	62	1	1	49	1	Essentially, you believe a fetus should be allowed to be killed simply for existing, while you protect the lives of people who have murdered other innocent people (as murder is generally what a person will get the death penalty for).	Especially given that you have accepted that some innocent people are executed.
2	25683	5572	53	266	3	22	22	1	People use the argument that we should not execute people based on the possibility that they may be innocent, but they could care less if we lock someone up for life who may be innocent.	First, we must choose to use executions because they may save innocent life.
3	33045	33045	37	35	3	14	4	3	The question is should the death penalty be allowed as a form of punishment.	Why do people even question whether death is an acceptable form of punishment in the first place?
1	14127	4690	79	88	3	4	3	1	Only some states use the death penalty, only some countries allow the death penalty.	the use of the death penalty is an act of revenge which cannot be undone, so should the state be put on trial for putting to death an innocent person?
3	17	31664	33	39	1	17	1	3	What if there were people killing other people, escaping from jail, doing it again etc.	Only .06% of people who have killed kill again when they escape, are released, etc.
3.333333333	2104	17	30	124	1	5	0	1	I would support the death penalty IF there was a way to ensure that it would not put innocent people to death.	So in reality, pushing the death penalty only ensures that more innocent people will be murdered.
1.333333333	30812	20886	113	1	3	0	1	3	If I were charged to do something that forced me to spend the rest of my life in jail, I would rather die right now - I think they're doing the criminal a favor by putting him down.	I believe that if person takes the life of another, he should lose his life.
1.333333333	32744	17	41	135	3	6	1	1	If a person commits murder, I don't believe they deserve to live.	I do not think that a government should be unable to kill someone, simply that they almost always should not.
2.333333333	4756	33045	96	75	1	1	2	3	Once the danger is gone killing a person is simply murder.	There are no children being killed, and killing a child is murder in America.
3.666666667	25683	17	58	124	3	0	0	1	I would support the death penalty IF there was a way to ensure that it would not put innocent people to death.	But I oppose the death penalty because it has the capacity to kill innocent people.
1.333333333	17	28050	130	84	1	1	4	3	In all honesty im glad i am not someone who has to decide murder as punishment for someone who has committed crimes.	There is no way to determine how many murders would have been committed.
2.333333333	5572	25683	216	91	1	2	23	3	Quite a lot of people think that criminals should be punished for the sake of punishing them, whether or not it deters anyone; I had thought you were one of them.	I believe that societies should punish criminals to the degree that they have to based on sound rational reasons.
1.333333333	14127	28050	49	64	3	4	9	3	There has seldom if ever been any occurrence in which someone has violently avenged a murderer's death.	Most people would agree that someone who kills someone in self defense doesn't deserve the death penalty, but there have been a couple of recent cases where someone killed someone in revenge for molesting their children.
1.333333333	4774	4690	32	107	1	1	8	1	I am not a big proponent of the death penalty.	In fact, I think if Jesus did not believe in the death penalty, it would make his sacrifice that much greater, because he would be being unjustly put to death.
2	22346	823	25	16	3	38	10	1	It is also possible for an innocent person to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, but nobody is making the argument to stop sending people to prison.	In every state that retains the death penalty, jurors have the option of sentencing convicted capital murderers to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
1	4690	2104	44	33	1	0	1	1	politicaly correct death penalty we impose here in America may not deter crime as well as we think it should.	Because we are all potential victims of violent crime, and I believe that there are violent crimes deserving of the death penalty.
3.666666667	25683	4756	85	39	3	9	1	1	It's been determined the death penalty is economically inefficient and I have yet to see any solid statistics displaying a defined deterrent factor.	Almost every study I've seen on the deterrent effect of the death penalty has suggested that it's no more effective than life imprisonment.
1.666666667	30812	5572	92	255	3	1	7	1	It seems that those that would be deterred by fear of punishment are already dettered by the threat of a life sentence.	but spending whole life in jail would be a better punishment
1.666666667	1128	2652	23	10	1	2	1	1	If a person wasn't convicted then they surely wouldn't be murdered by the state.	If they don't want to kill an innocent person, stick to life in prison.
3	25683	25683	90	35	3	33	0	3	Your description, that the death penalty is a deterrent, is incorrect.	The death penalty again has not only shown but proved to deter murder so therefore i wpuld suggest you reconsider your closing arguments.
1.333333333	31664	32744	27	21	3	6	1	3	I mean that if the death penalty would be legalized, people will scare to commit the crime.	It wouldn't shock me if someone committed murder JUST to get those things.
1.333333333	30697	12024	19	9	3	2	0	3	it has been proven time and again prisons don't rehabilitate, keeping someone in prision for their entire life in prision is less human than the death penalty.	The fact remains that life in prison is cheaper than sentencing one to the death penalty.
1.333333333	31664	28050	25	66	3	0	0	3	I think the death penalty is an archaic and obsolete form of punishment, even for the crime of murder.	I believe that murder is the killing of a human being.
3.333333333	4690	5572	32	266	1	1	7	1	Given the scrutiny of death penalty cases, it seems that we would be more likely to lock someone up for life in prison and never uncover their innocence than we are to execute an innocent person.	So should we be able to impose the sentence of life without parole, all the while understanding that we may have put an innocent man in prison for life?
2.333333333	31664	15556	54	6	3	1	3	3	if someone commits any crime, then they are a criminal by definition and should die.	The truth is that the Death Penalty punishes those who have convicted a crime of extreme severity, not any criminal who commits a crime.
1.666666667	5572	25683	140	67	1	0	12	3	If there was another factor, then there would have already been arguments against this study using other studies produced by the opponents of the death penalty to proved this theory wrong.	The argument for the death penalty as a deterrent has been proved wrong by the implementation of it through history.
3.666666667	5572	5572	266	266	1	7	22	1	People use the argument that we should not execute people based on the possibility that they may be innocent, but they could care less if we lock someone up for life who may be innocent.	Given the scrutiny of death penalty cases, it seems that we would be more likely to lock someone up for life in prison and never uncover their innocence than we are to execute an innocent person.
1.666666667	33642	5572	37	304	3	4	5	1	As far as someone killing while in prison, or escaping and killing innocents, I have addressed this too, and have stated that this is part of the reason I support the death penalty.	If these are indeed comparable, I wouldn't argue for the death penalty even in murder.
1.333333333	28050	7933	23	310	3	0	0	1	The death penalty doesn't need to serve as a deterrent to crime.	The death penalty doesn't need to become more equalized.
2.333333333	30697	20886	19	23	3	2	3	3	Hellno is right, capital punishment should be much more cost effective than the alternative- life in prison without parole.	The fact remains that life in prison is cheaper than sentencing one to the death penalty.
1.333333333	33642	13526	1	22	3	1	0	3	You say that all people who commit gruesome murders are psychopaths.	You might say the criminal deserved it, but murder is murder, whether they deserved it or not.
4.333333333	4690	4690	88	119	1	3	34	1	There are 17 death penalty states over the national average.	Only some states use the death penalty, only some countries allow the death penalty.
4.333333333	28050	28050	8	204	3	1	35	3	There's absolutely ZERO evidence that having a death penalty statute causes a lower crime rate, period.	The crime rate was higher after the death penalty than before it.
5	2652	5572	25	177	1	2	5	1	Anyway, the risk of killing an innocent is one arguement against the death penalty.	My argument is that innocent people have been killed by the death penalty.
3.333333333	25683	25683	67	73	3	10	3	3	If there was another factor associated with the increase in the murder rate and not the death penalty, then the article itself would have pointed it out.	If the execution rate decreased and the murder rate increased then that explains the deterrence effect of capital punishment.
1	28050	15556	105	12	3	1	2	3	So I think it is better to imprison those who deserve death for life, rather than even once as a people murder the wrong person.	, I believe the death penalty has deterred at least some people from committing murder.
4	20886	5572	23	136	3	0	2	1	I believe there are certain crimes where the death penalty is an acceptable punishment.	I don't think the death penalty should be banned.
5	7836	13175	1	22	3	0	0	3	I think the death penalty should only be used in extreme cases where the accused is, without a doubt, guilty.	Only in severe cases where there isn't a doubt that the person is guilty.
3	30812	7933	74	11	3	7	0	1	Though I would not call the death penalty murder, I am personally against it.	Like I said, I don't disagree with the theory of the death penalty.
2	7933	4690	2	107	1	5	8	1	I am not a big proponent of the death penalty.	The biggest problem I have with the death penalty is the cost.
1	14510	13293	64	8	3	1	3	3	I'm not saying that a child's life is worth more than an adults, I'm saying if they killed any one they forfeit their life, because they in return lose what they took from someone else.	When they are about to be shot just think what would be happening, some unlucky person would be dealing with the fact that they were going to have to take someone's life.
4	5572	17	265	128	1	0	3	1	If we don't stop the death penalty before we try to fix it, the imperfect system will continue to convict innocent people while we determine what is best for it.	So how about we stop a penalty that has executed innocents?
4	2104	28050	34	202	1	0	25	3	States without the death penalty have fared BETTER in reducing their murder rates than states with the death penalty.	There are many countries with lower murder rates than the U.S. and no death penalty.
1.666666667	1676	1676	47	26	1	1	2	1	The death of a criminal prevents him from committing any further crimes.	If a person is deterred from commiting a crime it is because fear in that person's mind has prevented him from commiting the crime.
5	4690	4756	147	9	1	2	25	1	There is, in fact, no proof that an innocent has been executed since 1900.	From what I have read, there has been no conclusive evidence of an innocent person killed by the death penalty since 1900.
4.333333333	17	17	128	128	1	1	4	1	We need to halt the death penalty before anyone else gets unjustly sentenced, then fix the problems (if that is even possible), and then, when we have safeguards in place, reinstitute it.	If we don't stop the death penalty now, we will put innocent people to death while we try to fix the problems.
1.333333333	31664	12024	24	1	3	1	1	3	I don't think everyone should be put to death.	I also don't think someone has been put to death for a third degree murder.
2	4690	17	87	64	1	16	2	1	If someone keeps killing and killing and killing, we need to stop him from taking lives.	We could get the person who may kill in the future.
1	25683	4756	58	62	3	4	49	1	Essentially, you believe a fetus should be allowed to be killed simply for existing, while you protect the lives of people who have murdered other innocent people (as murder is generally what a person will get the death penalty for).	therefore the death penalty should not be used, simply because it kills innocent people.
3	1676	14510	78	55	1	12	1	3	If someone kills my child, my parent, my siblings, my love, i would want them to pay the price.	If someone killed my relative, I wouldn't want them killed, I would want them to spend the rest of their lives in hard, back breaking labor.
5	18153	30697	52	27	3	2	1	3	First, it is more expensive than sentencing someone to life in prison.	First it is more expensive to kill a person, then letting him stay for a life long imprisonment.
3	2659	823	31	12	1	4	1	1	As of yet, we have not seen fact one that even one innocent person has been put to death.	That doesn't ensure that we don't end up murdering innocent people.
3	25683	22346	90	25	3	1	10	3	Moreover, states without the death penalty have much lower murder rates.	The murder rate for the state of New York, a state without the death penalty has increased this year with a higher rate of murder than it was in 2009.
2.333333333	4690	823	32	12	1	1	1	1	As of yet, we have not seen fact one that even one innocent person has been put to death.	So should we be able to impose the sentence of life without parole, all the while understanding that we may have put an innocent man in prison for life?
4	13293	17	8	135	3	3	1	1	If a person commits murder, I don't believe they deserve to live.	I'm not saying that a child's life is worth more than an adults, I'm saying if they killed any one they forfeit their life, because they in return lose what they took from someone else.
3	373	13293	15	8	1	0	3	3	I'm not saying that a child's life is worth more than an adults, I'm saying if they killed any one they forfeit their life, because they in return lose what they took from someone else.	I'm against captial punishment for the reasons that wjim1269 gave and also I think that just because someone murders someone it doesn't mean they should automatically forfeit their own life.
1	30812	5572	22	181	3	3	1	1	How many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent?	The way I see it people who murder shouldn't be sentenced to death or spend life in the jails we have here there to nice.
1.333333333	18153	14127	52	76	3	1	2	3	"If death penalty were the solution for such criminal actions, then people who are ""good"" and have contributed to society deserve to live forever."	There is not any good by taking the life of the criminal.
1	28050	28050	203	46	3	18	5	3	the death penalty is also discriminatory in its application what i mean is that through out the world the death penalty is disproportionately used against disadvantaged people .	The death penalty has been used as a scapegoat for many people who are against executions.
1.666666667	14127	25683	79	58	3	4	4	3	therefore the death penalty should not be used, simply because it kills innocent people.	the use of the death penalty is an act of revenge which cannot be undone, so should the state be put on trial for putting to death an innocent person?
2	7933	3065	31	67	1	9	0	1	How do you compare killing a little child who has never had the chance to live to the execution of a criminal who has been raping and killing little children?	If you rape a kid then you shouldn't be allowed to live.

1.333333333	14127	2104	46	16	3	2	3	1	People who will commit a crime with life in prison would probably still commit the crime with capital punishment.	People who commit bad crimes shouldn't be allowed to suffer in prison for the rest of their life.

And that killer has help, he has the people that support the death penalty and will give him more appeals, and if found guilty he'll get an easy way out with death, he won't have to suffer.
4.666666667	17	17	128	121	1	1	3	1	By the same token, if we keep administering the death penalty while the system is broken, we will have a much greater risk of putting someone innocent to death.

3	18153	28050	11	114	3	0	1	3	I agree that the people who are killed are mostly innocent people and that those killed by the death penalty are almost certainly guilty of the crime.	I think there should be a death penalty because, all those innocent people getting killed for no damn reason is unfair.
1.333333333	17	3271	131	39	1	3	3	1	The fact is that as long as we have a death penalty (the only Western nation to have it), we will execute innocents with the guilty.	If we execute death penalty, we will not be better than murderers.
1.333333333	7933	25683	228	87	1	5	31	3	I'm not saying we shouldn't do anything for the victims.	Besides I'm not saying we should apply the death penalty in all instances of murder for example.
1.666666667	22346	5572	10	39	3	3	14	1	Only if they try to murder somebody after they are in prison do they deserve the death penalty?	Well I think that if someone commits a crime worthy of the death penalty they should get a sentence for life that way they can't be a repeat offender.
1.666666667	17	2652	33	25	1	16	2	1	My argument is that innocent people have been killed by the death penalty.	An argument for putting people to death is so that they can never escape and kill again.

The argument for the death penalty as a deterrent has been proved wrong by the implementation of it through history.
1.333333333	32744	5572	7	38	3	4	4	1	You should also note that the one scenario I think the death penalty is acceptable for is if they try to escape using violence or if they attack another prisoner.	You are against of violence, but have you ever thought that death penalty is also violence?
2.666666667	5572	14510	266	11	1	7	1	3	There has been so much cases of people who have been executed, only to be found innocent after their death.

The death penalty is useless deterrent of crime because in the states that have them, they are not any more inclined to commit a crime because the threat of death penalty particularly if it is murder.
1.333333333	7933	33045	62	90	1	7	0	3	I think that if the murderer wants the death penalty, they should be allowed it if the victim's family agrees- but for crimes of passion and misunderstanding, no death penalty.	I have been a victim of rape and if I were a victim of murder I would not desire the death penalty for the perpetrator.
1.333333333	30812	12024	108	1	3	0	1	3	I don't think everyone should be put to death.	I think instead of a death penalty, they should just stay in prison until they die because putting someone to death is just harsh, No matter who it is.
1	5572	4774	200	8	1	11	11	1	God gave to government the legitimate authority to use capital punishment to restrain murder and to punish murderers.	The question with the death penalty is not kill or give no punishment.
1.333333333	5572	25683	97	101	1	2	14	3	If we kill our criminals, we see no opertunity for them to right their ways.	We let killers out of prison so they can kill again.
4	2104	33045	66	23	1	1	1	3	If the death penalty were an adequate deterrent then we would not have murder.	If capital punishment works (deterrent), why do we have such a high murder rate per capita?
2.333333333	7933	28050	40	1	1	1	6	3	People have, and will, be executed even though they are innocent of the crime.	So as long as only some innocent people are killed for crimes they didn't commit then the system must be sound.
5	5572	5572	255	196	1	7	6	1	Most people who would be deterred already seem to be deterred by life without parole as a punishment.	It seems that those that would be deterred by fear of punishment are already dettered by the threat of a life sentence.
3.666666667	28050	2104	215	34	3	2	0	1	There are many countries with lower murder rates than the U.S. and no death penalty.	Also, within the USA, murder rates are consistently lower in states that don't have capital punishment.
1.333333333	28050	14127	216	60	3	1	22	3	You can't just assume the death penalty is a crime.	It seems that you're assuming the correlation between crime rate and countries with capital punishment is that the death penalty encourages crime.

1	14127	15556	72	18	3	0	3	3	That should be a crime which should result in the death penalty.	Historically, the death penalty has not had any effect on crime.
3	28050	31664	8	18	3	1	3	3	BUT it is not apparent that death penalty lower crime rate.	The crime rate was higher after the death penalty than before it.
5	31664	31664	46	30	3	0	1	3	I say that they should be killed the same way that the person(s) that they killed were.	One way that would make me happy with the death penalty is if the person was killed in the same way as the person that they murdered.
1	5572	373	39	11	1	14	1	1	Capital punishment is killing someone as a punishment for a crime they committed.	Only if they try to murder somebody after they are in prison do they deserve the death penalty?

1.666666667	31664	28050	25	1	3	0	1	3	I think it is philosophically and morally justified to execute anyone who has murdered another human being.	I believe that murder is the killing of a human being.
2.666666667	2104	25683	64	58	1	1	0	3	But I oppose the death penalty because it has the capacity to kill innocent people.	I'm not really in favor of killing innocent people either.
1	107	33045	13	71	1	7	0	3	Yes, the death penalty should be use as a punishment.	What does this have to do with the death penalty?
3	31664	28050	27	200	3	3	0	3	There is absolutely ZERO evidence that the death penalty deters crime.	The thing is, without the death penalty there is absolutely no deterrent from committing heinous crimes.
3	4690	5065	147	1	1	1	22	1	There are also people who will tell you that the death penalty actually kills innocent people.	Exactly how many innocent people has the death penalty killed?
3	14510	25683	52	90	3	8	33	3	The death penalty again has not only shown but proved to deter murder so therefore i wpuld suggest you reconsider your closing arguments.	The death penalty has never been shown to be a deterent to murder.
4	13526	5572	8	136	3	7	2	1	I believe there are certain crimes where the death penalty is an acceptable punishment.	So all in all I believe in the death penalty.
2	20886	28050	23	178	3	0	0	3	The death penalty right now is to easy even I think.	I don't think the death penalty should be banned.
3.333333333	17	14127	122	88	1	1	10	3	studies show that the death penalty is not a deterrent (which is one half of the reason for it's use) and murder rates are actually higher in states that have the death penalty (http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/deterrence-states-without-death-penalty-                                       have-had-consistently-lower-murder-rates#stateswithvwithout).

2.666666667	31664	28237	9	8	3	0	7	3	Life imprisonment without parole is more effective than execution, and it is cheaper.	So your argument is that if the death penalty was cheaper than life in prison it would have the advantage of being cheaper than life in prison.
1.333333333	2652	4690	31	4	1	7	0	1	Ask the family members of who he killed if he deserves death.	And that killer has help, he has the people that support the death penalty and will give him more appeals, and if found guilty he'll get an easy way out with death, he won't have to suffer.

3.666666667	25683	28237	89	8	3	25	7	3	Life imprisonment without parole is more effective than execution, and it is cheaper.	The death penalty has not been shown to be more effective than life imprisonment in deterring murder, hence we should choose life imprisonment.

3.333333333	3065	4690	52	111	1	0	0	1	So I'm completely up front about it, I am adamently opposed to the death penalty period.	I am very conservative and I am opposed to abortion and the death penalty.
1	32744	32744	7	26	3	4	4	3	I feel as though you're implying that the death penalty is an effective crime deterrent.	You are against of violence, but have you ever thought that death penalty is also violence?
1	31664	373	27	28	3	6	3	1	Oh, and by the way, the criteria that I mentioned earlier was enough to kill someone for treason, so why shouldn't it be enough to kill someone for another crime?	It wouldn't shock me if someone committed murder JUST to get those things.
1	17	4756	33	68	1	17	18	1	They support it because killing murderers is the right thing to do.	Only .06% of people who have killed kill again when they escape, are released, etc.
1.333333333	3065	13293	76	16	1	2	0	3	I don't believe that they should because if you kill someone, they won't have the chance to either get rehabilitated nor will they have the chance to actually regret what they have done.	But why do you have to get rid of them by killing them.
2.666666667	14127	32744	72	5	3	0	1	3	The crimes meriting the death penalty are by-and-large not commited by those considering the consequences, no matter what those consequences may be.	Historically, the death penalty has not had any effect on crime.
2.333333333	8212	4756	16	68	3	4	18	1	They support it because killing murderers is the right thing to do.	The death penalty is gives the ability to off killers and murderers, as, if they were given life in parole, they have the ability to escape and continue their crimes.
2	7933	2652	314	30	1	2	9	1	All of the death penalty oppontents are for life in jail as opposed to the death penalty.I am sure that if some are found innocent,there are at least that many that are innocent and never set free.	Some innocent people are still sentenced to death, and that's where I see a problem.
1	25683	17	28	134	3	1	4	1	By killing a person who murdered someone, you are just doing the same thing you are punishing him/her for.	"Serial killers, ""How many people did you kill?"""

If somebody is completely innocent and they are executed for a crime they didn't commit (which, with forensics these days, probably will never happen again), that is a problem.

4.666666667	2659	2104	31	30	1	4	5	1	So in reality, pushing the death penalty only ensures that more innocent people will be murdered.	That doesn't ensure that we don't end up murdering innocent people.
4.666666667	1676	5572	90	48	1	8	4	1	On a national basis, these figures translate to an extra cost of over $1 billion spent since 1976 on the death penalty.	If you apply that cost to the rest of the nation�۪s executions, the nation has spent over $1 billion on capital punishment since the reinstatement of the penalty via Gregg vs. Georgia in 1976.

1.333333333	4690	823	78	49	1	3	0	1	The point is, when a crime is committed that warrants the death penalty and there is irrefutable evidence to suggest that the personal being held responsible is guilty, than they should be sentenced to death.	An argument regarding the death penalty should be confined to discussions regarding those who have been wrongly convicted and sentenced to death.
4	25683	13175	50	1	3	1	4	3	There have been numerous people who were presumed innocent after execution because the evidence showed that they were not guilty.	I have evidence that says that innocent people are convicted of crimes.
1	5572	3271	271	69	1	16	7	1	So between 336 to 672 innocent people  have staistically been excecuted since Gregg Vs Georgia took place.	And some people should be thrown away without being executed.
2	31664	31664	48	61	3	1	6	3	The killer is not going to take away innocent lives anymore because the killer is dead.	Is the victim going to come back that the criminal is dead?
3.333333333	18153	22346	42	25	3	0	0	3	There are many reasons the death penalty should be abolished.	The abolishment of the death penalty is considered an advancement in most societies.
3	14127	5572	79	188	3	6	0	1	I think that criminals view the death penalty as worse than life imprisonment and worse than temporary solitary confinement within life imprisonment - at least given the conditions in American prisons.	i think that life without opportunity of parole is the more humane and just punishment instead of the death penalty.
2.666666667	28050	18153	64	52	3	0	0	3	There should no be a death penalty, since by taking a human's life, we are not saving it.	If we continue to allow the death penalty, we are no better than the murderers and rapists that we punish with the death penalty.
1	33045	28237	13	8	3	3	5	3	If convicts believe their innocence, appeals through life imprisonment is much more justifiable because it is easier to atone for a life imprisonment as opposed to death.	This is about pro-life views and their compatibility with pro-death penalty views.
2	22346	28050	17	169	3	0	0	3	I say kill 'em, they're a waste of the federal budget.	Like I said I would just want them to actually have to deal with the consequences and not get an easy out, which is what executing them does.

2	5572	17	259	121	1	2	3	1	By the same token, if we keep administering the death penalty while the system is broken, we will have a much greater risk of putting someone innocent to death.	IMHO, if we have the confidence in our system to throw someone in a cage for the rest of their natural life we should have the same confidence to put someone to death.
2.333333333	6937	5572	28	292	1	1	9	1	Deterrence is not the only reason I support the death penalty.	The reasons given most often for supporting the death penalty are emotional reasons of retribution for the heinous acts of the criminal.

4.333333333	4690	7933	9	11	1	3	21	1	Unless there can be solid uncontestable evidence shown that the death penalty is significant in deterring crime, this cannot be used as an argument for the death penalty.	Since there is no clear evidence indicating that there is any deterrent value to the death penalty, I have trouble rationalizing it as a punishment.
3	17	107	7	6	1	8	18	1	Jesus did NOT make it clear the death penalty was wrong, he made it clear that personal revenge is wrong.	it is quite clear that Jesus did not support the death penalty.
2	5572	4690	151	54	1	5	1	1	You need to find lots more for the death penalty to save more lives than innocents that have been executed by it.	Life without parole lets you fix that mistake since they can be released if they are found innocent - not so with the death penalty.
2	2659	4690	31	47	1	4	3	1	If we fail to execute murderers, and doing so would in fact have deterred other murders, we have allowed the killing of a bunch of innocent victims.	That doesn't ensure that we don't end up murdering innocent people.
1	22346	5572	17	36	3	0	27	1	I say if they try to kill/escape from life w/o parole in prison that's all we should need for the death penalty.	Like I said I would just want them to actually have to deal with the consequences and not get an easy out, which is what executing them does.
1	14127	7933	85	228	3	4	9	1	Justice is applying a penalty or punishment for a wrong deed done.	Yeah, including the human judgment that says that the death penalty is wrong.
3	14510	1676	20	78	3	5	12	1	If someone killed my relative, I wouldn't want them killed, I would want them to spend the rest of their lives in hard, back breaking labor.	Someone in my family, honestly I would want that person to take the death penalty.
1	22346	5572	17	183	3	0	1	1	"I suppose you could say ""well it keeps them from harming society"" but so does the death penalty."	Like I said I would just want them to actually have to deal with the consequences and not get an easy out, which is what executing them does.
1.666666667	14127	5572	89	145	3	13	7	1	In the case of the death penalty, the crime committed is so terrible that society is no longer concerned with teaching a lesson; they simply want to be free of these terrible criminals.	And no, society is not better served by life imprisonment than the death penalty because society then learns that consequences aren't very severe for committing an act of murder.
3.333333333	2652	13526	16	25	1	0	1	3	I personally would never wish death penalty on someone no matter what they did to me/family/friends I would just want them in jail for a life sentence because then the threat is pretty much over.	I am personally against the death penalty but would like to know in this particular scenario how just giving him life in prison would have been any different.
1.333333333	4690	28050	78	209	1	3	16	3	Arguments that support the death penalty are the only ones that can reference the Constitution.	An argument regarding the death penalty should be confined to discussions regarding those who have been wrongly convicted and sentenced to death.
1.333333333	13526	4690	22	119	3	0	3	1	Hitler killed a whole race, you are basically saying you don't mind if we kill a bunch of innocent people as long as we get guilty people as well.	You say that all people who commit gruesome murders are psychopaths.
1	28050	3186	77	17	3	2	1	1	Could it be that people are going to commit the crimes anyway no matter what the punishment is, so the sentence we pass should be sufficient to prevent reoffending only.	maybe we should start with what crimes warrant the death penalty.
1.333333333	4690	15556	40	15	1	3	3	3	Some crimes are so heinous that the person who committed the crime deserves to die: I would only agree to this if the execution erased the crime that was committed in the first place.	If I could be satisfactorily convinced that a murderer had ZERO chance of committing another crime, I might be convinced to do away with the death penalty.
2.666666667	4690	5065	149	1	1	7	6	1	By not giving the death penalty to a slaughtering murderer, we are telling the world that the life of this murderer is worth more than that of his victim.	We seem to have more compassion for the victims and potential victims of murderers than we do for the murderers.
4.333333333	7933	5572	2	50	1	6	1	1	The death penalty (because of appeals) costs more than solitary confinement for life, both of which would ensure that the person would never kill again.	With trials and appeals, one execution can end up costing more than a life sentence by the time the execution is actually carried out.
3	4690	2104	32	13	1	1	2	1	The list of men on death row who were found to be innocent and released is long and growing, and we can only guess how many innocents have been put to death.	So should we be able to impose the sentence of life without parole, all the while understanding that we may have put an innocent man in prison for life?
1.666666667	14127	7933	75	57	3	4	2	1	One of the many grievances I have is that child rapists don't qualify for the death penalty unless the child that gets raped is also killed.	We must look into why the person raped a child or murdered a father.
2.666666667	18153	5572	3	188	3	5	3	1	I suppose that, for most people, having to serve a life sentence without parole would already ruin their life enough that any who would be detered by fear of punishment are already detered.	Without fear of punishment, some people cannot be controlled.
2	5065	32744	1	3	1	5	0	3	No, if it is already known that this person made the crime, the death penalty may be used.	When a person commits a crime, the Judicial system is responsible for determining a proportional response or penalty for the crime.
1	30812	17	48	132	3	1	2	1	I am tired of seeing people on death row for 20 or 30 years before they are put to death.	For some people death penalty is better than life in prison, who are respect their freedom and who are consider that it is better to die than someone to judge them.
1	3271	14127	118	35	1	4	7	3	Well according to your own paper, it says that you can't prove that the death penalty increases the murder rate.	Even though you deny it, your statements show you have no problem executing innocent people.
3.333333333	7933	823	31	37	1	5	17	1	What we need are harsher sentences including the death penalty.	In fact I'll go a step further and state that we're too lax with the death penalty, we need to make it more severe.
1	28050	2104	77	33	3	2	1	1	politicaly correct death penalty we impose here in America may not deter crime as well as we think it should.	maybe we should start with what crimes warrant the death penalty.
1.333333333	1128	14127	34	92	1	1	17	3	Still, in some cases death penalty would be the right thing to do (no point keeping mentally insane murderers just locked up for their whole life, although there could be some ways to use them).	If a criminal asks for the death penalty, give them a psychiatric evaluation to determine their mental state.
1.666666667	3065	22346	95	10	1	0	3	3	Well I think that if someone commits a crime worthy of the death penalty they should get a sentence for life that way they can't be a repeat offender.	i think the death penalty should be abolished because some people are sentenced to deathfor a crime they might have not committed.
1.333333333	30812	5572	83	97	3	2	2	1	We let killers out of prison so they can kill again.	>>>If we are sure they raped & killed those innocent children then we should let them die.
1.333333333	28050	373	115	11	3	0	1	1	Capital punishment is killing someone as a punishment for a crime they committed.	If someone is bad enough to be considered for the death penalty then they must have had sure evidence that they are guilty if they are then they shouldn't deserve the right to live among people they could kill
1	31664	5572	25	24	3	3	1	1	This is why I said what I said in the first place about why I'm against the death penalty.	I don't think anyone has been put the death for third degree murder either.
3	20886	32744	3	26	3	4	4	3	I feel as though you're implying that the death penalty is an effective crime deterrent.	The death penalty has been found to be a more effective deterrent to crimes against children.
3	6937	6937	62	63	1	0	0	1	My conscience says that it the death penalty is immoral.	The moral law, speaking through my conscience has no problem with the death penalty.
1.333333333	25683	30812	83	36	3	3	0	3	Death penalty are given to those who have comitted a very serious crime.	If these bleak prospects aren't enough to deter someone from committing a serious crime, what will ramping it up to the death penalty do?
2.666666667	4690	13175	152	1	1	2	4	3	There have been numerous people who were presumed innocent after execution because the evidence showed that they were not guilty.	Even the people who did the study saying that innocents had been executed admitted that they cannot prove same.
1.333333333	31664	33045	49	35	3	21	4	3	The question is should the death penalty be allowed as a form of punishment.	Therefore, the Death Penalty stands as a humane form of justice.
2.666666667	30697	25683	17	83	3	0	3	3	If these bleak prospects aren't enough to deter someone from committing a serious crime, what will ramping it up to the death penalty do?	Death penalty should be allowed as it deters people from committing serious crimes such as murder.
2.666666667	7933	4690	314	18	1	2	2	1	The notion that innocent people may be sentenced to death is not a death penalty problem, it is a judicial system problem.	Some innocent people are still sentenced to death, and that's where I see a problem.
3	3065	30697	95	7	1	0	2	3	For that I do not disagree, yes hundreds maybe thousands of people have either been sentenced to death or served a period of time in jail for a crime they did not commit.	i think the death penalty should be abolished because some people are sentenced to deathfor a crime they might have not committed.
3.333333333	2104	28050	66	8	1	1	1	3	The crime rate was higher after the death penalty than before it.	If capital punishment works (deterrent), why do we have such a high murder rate per capita?
3	373	17	15	135	1	0	1	1	If a person commits murder, I don't believe they deserve to live.	I'm against captial punishment for the reasons that wjim1269 gave and also I think that just because someone murders someone it doesn't mean they should automatically forfeit their own life.
1.333333333	33642	15556	1	12	3	0	2	3	So I think it is better to imprison those who deserve death for life, rather than even once as a people murder the wrong person.	If murder is wrong than so is the death penalty.
1	28050	4690	203	88	3	18	3	1	Only some states use the death penalty, only some countries allow the death penalty.	The death penalty has been used as a scapegoat for many people who are against executions.
2	25683	6937	40	36	3	7	1	1	Murder is murder and those who execute the death penalty are murderers as well.	The death penalty is also based on rationality of murder.
1.666666667	4690	3065	76	23	1	3	1	1	But I can't get past the fact that they'll be killed for killing someone else - it's hypocritical.	...and if I do someday murder someone, I should be killed.
2.666666667	2659	2104	39	9	1	0	9	1	I am not sure, which also begs the question on my support for the death penalty.	I used to be for the death penalty, however two things made me question my position.
2.666666667	28050	28050	182	93	3	1	0	3	What does them being released have to do with the death penalty?	Some people totally deserve the death penalty and I would hate it if they were released.
1.333333333	5572	30812	200	9	1	11	0	3	God specifically gives the government permission to punish murderers by death.	The question with the death penalty is not kill or give no punishment.
1.333333333	4690	25683	44	87	1	0	31	3	I'm not saying we shouldn't do anything for the victims.	Because we are all potential victims of violent crime, and I believe that there are violent crimes deserving of the death penalty.
1	3065	36893	88	1	1	5	0	3	Yes, death penalty is not a qualified punishment for a crime.	abortion does not qualify as state murder like the death penalty.
1	14510	5572	49	234	3	0	2	1	So if someone cared more about money then the life of the prisoner (as I do), they'd be aganist the current form of the penalty in America.	I'm also against death penalty because no one except God has the right to take person's life.
1.666666667	4690	17	87	108	1	16	0	1	That right to life was taken away, I agree, but we will not accomplish anything if we kill someone else.	We could get the person who may kill in the future.
4	2652	2652	31	30	1	7	7	1	Think of the torment in the families minds,knowing that that killer is doing everything he can to get out.And that killer has help,he has the people that want to ban the death penalty!!!!!	And that killer has help, he has the people that support the death penalty and will give him more appeals, and if found guilty he'll get an easy way out with death, he won't have to suffer.
2.666666667	4756	14510	68	63	1	18	0	3	that is why I support it for serial killers, I don't really support it for a murderer.	They support it because killing murderers is the right thing to do.
2.666666667	7933	18153	256	7	1	2	0	3	while it is a fact that innocent people have been placed and convicted to death row condemned to die, there are however people who are guilty and should die.	The antepenultimate man to be sentenced to death was innocent.
1.333333333	5572	7836	200	11	1	11	4	3	"The debate question asks ""Should the death penalty be legalized?"""	The question with the death penalty is not kill or give no punishment.
3	7933	5572	56	255	1	1	4	1	Since there are many people sentenced for murder that are actually innocent (~10% who were sentenced to death who were proved innocent in appeal), you would be causing a lot more innocent deaths than you would be saving.	Especially given that you have accepted that some innocent people are executed.
2.333333333	31664	13293	52	13	3	6	6	3	Back to reality, we convict the wrong person all the time, and we've set up a system where death penalty is actually more expensive than life in prison.	As long as we sentence people to a life in prison we are also GUARANTEED to sentence an innocent person.
1	5572	22346	225	30	1	1	10	3	(4)Death penalty does not intimidate people from committing a crime.	Many people find some crimes heinous enough to warrent the death penalty.
1	4690	25683	202	110	1	0	0	3	I see no point in letting someone live who does not want to live, or letting someone die who does not want to die.	"If I ever ""murder"" someone without cause, I would deserve to die."
2	33642	4756	21	13	3	0	1	1	I support the death penalty because I feel that their are crimes and criminals so heinous that they deserve death.	I am not disagreeing with punishing criminals for crimes they have committed.
2	3065	13293	23	16	1	1	0	3	I don't believe that they should because if you kill someone, they won't have the chance to either get rehabilitated nor will they have the chance to actually regret what they have done.	But I can't get past the fact that they'll be killed for killing someone else - it's hypocritical.
2.333333333	7933	17	292	63	1	9	13	1	I would rather have justice be done than to give a rapist the chance to grab another little girl or a murderer to have the chance to kill an innocent person I might know or care about.	I don't care if it is in the name of justice or if someone just wants to avenge a death, murder is murder, no matter how it is done.
1	33045	18153	38	11	3	21	0	3	I think there should be a death penalty because, all those innocent people getting killed for no damn reason is unfair.	I don't even give a shit about the death penalty, I was just making a point.
1.666666667	7933	32206	40	20	1	1	3	3	You make it sound as though if someone is innocent, of anything, they should be killed.	So as long as only some innocent people are killed for crimes they didn't commit then the system must be sound.
1.666666667	33045	4774	63	55	3	3	24	1	of course, if you refuse to call and die in your sins, then you've executed the death penalty upon yourself.	If you support the death penalty and concede that an innocent man could be put to death, you must be willing to put your name in the hat, with every one else, to have the government execute you by mistake.
2	22346	32744	20	24	3	0	8	3	Killing a person for them killing someone else ( I understand this is not necessarily the criteria for receiving the death penalty) makes you no better than the executed.	I see what you mean, but i'm still against killing people .
1.666666667	31664	4774	49	13	3	3	1	1	The death penalty executes felons found guilty of especially heinous crimes.	The death penalty is an act of justice, yes justice, which while unable to supplement for the losses of others, can secure the isolation of a convicted criminal and also deliver a punishment for the crime.
3.333333333	22346	28050	25	195	3	0	5	3	"If anything, this kind of ""argument"" is an argument for abolishing the death penalty, since it isn't used uniformly across the entire country."	There are many reasons the death penalty should be abolished.
4.333333333	8212	22346	16	7	3	11	1	3	And the purpose of the death penalty is not to punish, but to deter further crime.	The death penalty is in place to prevent further crimes, not to please the victim's family.
1	7933	373	265	1	1	3	9	1	C: The main CON argument against capital punishment is that he should have second chance.	So what does he have to do with a debate like this about murderers and the death penalty?
1.666666667	5304	823	6	9	1	1	1	1	If that is the case I am against Capital Punishment.	In all cases, the first punishment shouldn't be the death penalty.
3.666666667	28050	33045	36	28	3	1	2	3	The death penalty is not about only deterrence, but also to say that life will be protected and murder will not be tolerated.	The death penalty is sometimes claimed to save lives through deterrence.
2	5572	28050	266	113	1	9	2	3	I have heard that there are false verdicts and that some innocent people are killed accidentally, but that number is decreasing year by year.	However, I do not see any moral difference in locking up an innocent person for 60 year or executing an innocent person.
1.333333333	2104	20886	64	4	1	1	1	3	The government does not have the right to kill people.	I'm not really in favor of killing innocent people either.
2.666666667	4690	18153	62	52	1	9	0	3	There should no be a death penalty, since by taking a human's life, we are not saving it.	If it has nothing to do with the death penalty, how could it have anything to do with lives saved by the death penalty in the first place?
1.666666667	5572	31664	292	17	1	9	0	3	The reason to be for the death penalty is because it is just; the same foundation of support for all sanctions.	Deterrence is not the only reason I support the death penalty.
3	28050	25683	202	67	3	25	10	3	If the execution rate decreased and the murder rate increased then that explains the deterrence effect of capital punishment.	States without the death penalty have fared BETTER in reducing their murder rates than states with the death penalty.
1.333333333	3065	1676	68	47	1	7	1	1	If a person is deterred from commiting a crime it is because fear in that person's mind has prevented him from commiting the crime.	Second, he killed someone during the commission of another crime.
4.666666667	28050	30697	68	27	3	8	1	3	First, it is more expensive than sentencing someone to life in prison.	Not to mention that the death penalty is more costly than simple life in prison in both money and time.
2.666666667	4690	2652	4	30	1	0	7	1	Think of the torment in the families minds,knowing that that killer is doing everything he can to get out.And that killer has help,he has the people that want to ban the death penalty!!!!!	Ask the family members of who he killed if he deserves death.
1.333333333	2652	4690	31	47	1	7	0	1	If the same murderer had been given the death penalty, and never released in the first place, he would not be able to kill again.	And that killer has help, he has the people that support the death penalty and will give him more appeals, and if found guilty he'll get an easy way out with death, he won't have to suffer.
1.333333333	2659	30812	31	83	1	4	2	3	>>>If we are sure they raped & killed those innocent children then we should let them die.	That doesn't ensure that we don't end up murdering innocent people.
1	32744	14127	7	74	3	4	8	3	My final point is, whether you believe in the afterlife or whether you think once we're dead this is it, do you not think death is the least punishing form of punishment?	You are against of violence, but have you ever thought that death penalty is also violence?
4.333333333	5572	30812	260	93	1	1	0	3	For sheer purposes of punishing a criminal, I don't support the death penalty.	This is why I'm aganist the penalty as punishment.

1	5572	5572	256	95	1	13	2	1	OF THE VICTIM would be able to visit or at least know they're family members are alive if the criminal hadn't KILLED THEM!!	If they know they'll die if caught, they'll likely kill more rape victims and children.
1	823	32744	9	41	1	8	6	3	I do not think that a government should be unable to kill someone, simply that they almost always should not.	If someone were to torture and kill one of my kids, I don�۪t think killing them would be punishment enough.
4	4756	28050	18	34	1	1	1	3	Does the death penalty deter evil more than life in prison?	Because justice operates to protect society by deterring future crime, one would have to show that the death penalty prevents more crime than life in prison, thus fulfilling the function of justice better than that of life in prison.
1.666666667	28050	12024	115	14	3	0	0	3	The problem with the death penalty is eventually someone will be sentenced to death when they are in fact guilty.	If someone is bad enough to be considered for the death penalty then they must have had sure evidence that they are guilty if they are then they shouldn't deserve the right to live among people they could kill
1	15556	1676	18	26	3	3	2	1	The death of a criminal prevents him from committing any further crimes.	That should be a crime which should result in the death penalty.

1	5572	33045	39	77	1	14	0	3	If someone is wrongly convicted of a crime and put in jail, they can be released if they're found to be innocent.	Only if they try to murder somebody after they are in prison do they deserve the death penalty?

I mean the death penalty is giving them a passage out of trouble, they wouldn't have to deal with the effects they had on the world.
1.666666667	31664	13293	30	16	3	1	0	3	I don't believe that they should because if you kill someone, they won't have the chance to either get rehabilitated nor will they have the chance to actually regret what they have done.

1	14510	33045	54	23	3	49	1	3	If the death penalty were an adequate deterrent then we would not have murder.	If we can not prevent the innocent from unjust punishment, we should not have the death penalty.
1.333333333	28050	5572	113	181	3	1	1	1	How many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent?	The people dying from the death penalty are guilty people who have taken the lives of others.

1.333333333	17	4774	130	13	1	1	1	1	The death penalty executes felons found guilty of especially heinous crimes.	There is no way to determine how many murders would have been committed.
1.666666667	22346	373	13	5	3	0	10	1	These two statistics show that the justice system is too imperfect for capital punishment to be used effectively.	The death penalty is an effective deterrent when used properly.
1.333333333	33045	3065	35	74	3	4	0	1	The question of the death penalty is a tricky issue.	The question is should the death penalty be allowed as a form of punishment.

1.333333333	5572	5572	33	97	1	2	2	1	We let killers out of prison so they can kill again.	Long prison time only costs us money and is a huge waste... I suppose we can do a involuntary servitude thing for first time offenders or something if you have a real problem with killing them though...

In any case, he didn't say that the penalty for sin is death, he said the penalty for one particular action which Adam couldn't even know was wrong, being unaware of good and evil, was death.
2.333333333	373	1128	5	23	1	2	1	1	They shouldn't want to send an innocent person to prison for life either so it should have been pretty clear they were guilty already.	If we sentence someone to life in prison, we can always free them at a later time if they are found to be innocent.
1.333333333	8212	7933	17	265	3	1	3	1	So what does he have to do with a debate like this about murderers and the death penalty?	Without the death penalty, the criminal would probably die in prison because it is very unlikely he would be released or escape.
4.333333333	5572	5572	222	196	1	10	6	1	Most people who would be deterred already seem to be deterred by life without parole as a punishment.	Statistics show that capital punishment is no more of a deterrent than life without parole so I fail to see your arguement about society needing capital punishment.

The way I see it people who murder shouldn't be sentenced to death or spend life in the jails we have here there to nice.
1.666666667	28050	4690	36	62	3	1	9	1	If it has nothing to do with the death penalty, how could it have anything to do with lives saved by the death penalty in the first place?	The death penalty is sometimes claimed to save lives through deterrence.
2	1128	33045	23	77	1	1	0	3	If someone is wrongly convicted of a crime and put in jail, they can be released if they're found to be innocent.	They shouldn't want to send an innocent person to prison for life either so it should have been pretty clear they were guilty already.
1	5572	2652	256	10	1	13	1	1	If a person wasn't convicted then they surely wouldn't be murdered by the state.	If they know they'll die if caught, they'll likely kill more rape victims and children.
3.666666667	28050	5572	196	255	3	0	6	1	Indeed, the states with the death penalty on average have a higher per capita murder rate than those without - suggesting that other factors (economy, etc.) play a much larger role.	Most other first-world countries don't have the death penalty, but have lower rates of crime, just pointing that out.

3	4690	7933	149	92	1	7	6	1	Part of the problem we have in America is people feel sympathy for criminals, even the violent ones.	We seem to have more compassion for the victims and potential victims of murderers than we do for the murderers.
1	30812	28050	97	86	3	16	1	3	i think most people here are arguing that our justice system does not require absolute certainty in order to sentence someone to the death penalty, and we can almost never have absolute certainty.	Exactly the sort of person that we might want put to death by the justice system.
3.333333333	5572	32744	36	42	1	19	2	3	If it must be, then we shall find a way to improve these peoples habits, not kill them because they aren't 'like us'.	We shouldn't just kill someone if they commit a crime.
1.333333333	1676	4690	59	119	1	6	11	1	The death penalty doesn't reverse the death of the victim.	The death penalty is not deterrance for the person executed.
1.333333333	5572	13175	301	18	1	18	3	3	If a person just raped someone (this is just an example) they shouldn't be killed for it, but something like a mass murdering or serial killing should be dealt with by putting them to death.	Same with the others, if they are in solitary and they succeed in killing someone else , death penalty then fine.
4.333333333	30697	28050	7	151	3	2	11	3	The studies are very clear that people are routinely convicted of crimes that they never committed, period.	For that I do not disagree, yes hundreds maybe thousands of people have either been sentenced to death or served a period of time in jail for a crime they did not commit.
1	8212	14510	16	20	3	4	13	3	So, when someone gets the death penalty, they chose their own fate by committing the crime.	The death penalty is gives the ability to off killers and murderers, as, if they were given life in parole, they have the ability to escape and continue their crimes.
1.333333333	5572	5572	38	183	1	4	1	1	"I suppose you could say ""well it keeps them from harming society"" but so does the death penalty."	You should also note that the one scenario I think the death penalty is acceptable for is if they try to escape using violence or if they attack another prisoner.
1.333333333	5304	33045	6	37	1	1	14	3	Why do people even question whether death is an acceptable form of punishment in the first place?	In all cases, the first punishment shouldn't be the death penalty.
1	22346	25683	20	7	3	0	22	3	I highly doubt the backing of why you personally would want the death penalty invoked is because you're worried at home that a mass murderer is going to escape and kill you or someone you love... seriously?	I see what you mean, but i'm still against killing people .
2.333333333	4690	25683	62	42	1	13	15	3	Even if the death penalty does not deter serial killers, it prevents them from killing again in society or in prison.	Both the death penalty and a life sentence would have prevent further murders.

3.666666667	4690	5572	185	287	1	27	2	1	Many people argue that the death penalty is not a detterence.	Furthermore, any assertion that the death penalty is not a deterrent is false.
2	4756	33045	13	90	1	1	0	3	I think that if the murderer wants the death penalty, they should be allowed it if the victim's family agrees- but for crimes of passion and misunderstanding, no death penalty.	I support the death penalty because I feel that their are crimes and criminals so heinous that they deserve death.
3.333333333	4756	15556	13	15	1	1	3	3	Some crimes are so heinous that the person who committed the crime deserves to die: I would only agree to this if the execution erased the crime that was committed in the first place.

2.666666667	25683	5572	84	268	3	11	30	1	The penalty is seen as vengence, why do they let families of the victims watch?	Punishment and retribution is a right of the family after there loved ones were taken away from them and no one should tell them that they do not have the right to.
1	25683	33045	84	88	3	11	5	3	Because they love to butt-fuck and they're usually pro-capitol punishment.	Punishment and retribution is a right of the family after there loved ones were taken away from them and no one should tell them that they do not have the right to.
3	3065	4756	76	68	1	2	18	1	They support it because killing murderers is the right thing to do.	But why do you have to get rid of them by killing them.
1.333333333	5304	31664	6	25	1	1	2	3	Death penalty is then in this case a lawful murder.	In all cases, the first punishment shouldn't be the death penalty.
2	4774	32744	53	1	1	9	0	3	Yes, because death penalty will really make people think more deeply before kill somebody or steal something.	As it is today, when someone murderers another, the death penalty is considered, as it should be.
2.333333333	25683	14510	84	20	3	4	13	3	So, when someone gets the death penalty, they chose their own fate by committing the crime.	Therefore, people will think twice before they choose to commit a crime and also, the death penalty has been proven to deter the crime rate.
3	3065	28050	95	208	1	0	9	3	Nonsense, the issue of people being put to death for crimes that they likely NEVER committed is only one issue with the death penalty.	i think the death penalty should be abolished because some people are sentenced to deathfor a crime they might have not committed.
1.333333333	5572	28050	51	64	1	22	2	3	Killing the criminal would just make others angry, since there are other ways to take criminals out of the streets, like life sentences.	There would be executions for murderers and jail time for others.
1	3065	14510	74	8	1	16	11	3	It is proved that death penalty for such kind people is the simplest punishment.	So, the only reason I can really see why people support the death penalty is to have simple vengeance against the perpretrator.
2.666666667	7933	1676	310	49	1	0	2	1	IE - the death penalty acts as a deterrent to other would be murderers.	The death penalty doesn't need to serve as a deterrent to crime.

1.333333333	1676	7933	22	310	1	5	0	1	The death penalty doesn't need to serve as a deterrent to crime.	There are some who need to be put to death.

5	3065	25683	74	81	1	16	0	3	Last time I checked, killing doesn't bring persons back to life, so the only reason for the death penalty seems to be revenge.	So, the only reason I can really see why people support the death penalty is to have simple vengeance against the perpretrator.
1	14510	18153	64	16	3	1	1	3	I dont believe that someone who killed or raped a lot of people should be able to live even if they are in a jail surrounded by other criminals.

1	5572	17	270	134	1	9	4	1	By killing a person who murdered someone, you are just doing the same thing you are punishing him/her for.	After all, the person you're torturing may actually be innocent.
3.666666667	25683	20886	84	3	3	4	4	3	The death penalty has been found to be a more effective deterrent to crimes against children.	Therefore, people will think twice before they choose to commit a crime and also, the death penalty has been proven to deter the crime rate.

Death is a much kinder sentence than life in prison, if you are sentenced to life, you should get to suffer for the whole bit.
2.666666667	7933	4690	314	115	1	2	0	1	With all this talk about innocent people being put to death, I was wondering.	Some innocent people are still sentenced to death, and that's where I see a problem.
2	33045	17	75	64	3	2	2	1	If someone keeps killing and killing and killing, we need to stop him from taking lives.	Once the danger is gone killing a person is simply murder.
3.333333333	25683	2104	62	48	3	2	5	1	Comparable countries without the death penalty have fewer murders then Texas.	Texas, with many executions, followed the same trend as states without any executions.
2	33642	7933	37	252	3	4	2	1	I am not a pacifist, so I am not opposed to all state-sanctioned killing.	If these are indeed comparable, I wouldn't argue for the death penalty even in murder.
1.333333333	18153	25683	11	112	3	0	6	3	I think only certain people deserve to have the death penalty.	I think there should be a death penalty because, all those innocent people getting killed for no damn reason is unfair.
1	5572	3271	136	88	1	2	1	1	The way I see it, capital punishment doesn't have to be expensive at all.	I believe there are certain crimes where the death penalty is an acceptable punishment.
1.333333333	4756	4690	11	40	1	4	3	1	If I could be satisfactorily convinced that a murderer had ZERO chance of committing another crime, I might be convinced to do away with the death penalty.	Again, I support the death penalty for certain crimes and criminals.
1	2659	4690	39	115	1	0	0	1	With all this talk about innocent people being put to death, I was wondering.	I used to be for the death penalty, however two things made me question my position.
4	28050	13175	1	1	3	6	4	3	There have been numerous people who were presumed innocent after execution because the evidence showed that they were not guilty.	People have, and will, be executed even though they are innocent of the crime.
4.333333333	33045	7836	35	11	3	4	4	3	"The debate question asks ""Should the death penalty be legalized?"""	The question is should the death penalty be allowed as a form of punishment.
1.333333333	28050	28050	105	66	3	1	0	3	I think the death penalty is an archaic and obsolete form of punishment, even for the crime of murder.	, I believe the death penalty has deterred at least some people from committing murder.
2.333333333	4756	3186	11	8	1	4	0	1	I do not support the death penalty - but it's not because I feel bad for criminals.	Again, I support the death penalty for certain crimes and criminals.
1.333333333	28050	28050	105	114	3	1	1	3	I agree that the people who are killed are mostly innocent people and that those killed by the death penalty are almost certainly guilty of the crime.	, I believe the death penalty has deterred at least some people from committing murder.
1.333333333	31664	5572	24	24	3	1	1	1	This is why I said what I said in the first place about why I'm against the death penalty.	I also don't think someone has been put to death for a third degree murder.
3	5572	14510	164	37	1	0	13	3	A life sentence does not prevent a murderer from murdering again.	But life imprisonment without parole also deters the criminal from recommitting.
1.333333333	28050	1676	23	22	3	0	5	1	There are some who need to be put to death.	The death penalty doesn't need to become more equalized.
1	30812	2104	36	16	3	0	3	1	People who will commit a crime with life in prison would probably still commit the crime with capital punishment.	Death penalty are given to those who have comitted a very serious crime.
1	5572	3271	186	88	1	15	1	1	The way I see it, capital punishment doesn't have to be expensive at all.	In reality I wouldn't care if the death penalty were gone.
2.666666667	33045	373	23	2	3	1	5	1	If we slap a guarantueed death penalty on murder then any following murderer commits the crime on pain of death which is a much better detterent.	If the death penalty were an adequate deterrent then we would not have murder.
4.333333333	30697	28237	19	8	3	2	7	3	Life imprisonment without parole is more effective than execution, and it is cheaper.	The fact remains that life in prison is cheaper than sentencing one to the death penalty.
3.333333333	5572	31664	268	47	1	30	18	3	The death penalty should never be seen as 'an eye for an eye' or as a relief for a victim or those close to them.	The penalty is seen as vengence, why do they let families of the victims watch?
1.666666667	13526	4690	15	88	3	0	3	1	Only some states use the death penalty, only some countries allow the death penalty.	No, in 99.999of; the time there are other options, states still allow the death penalty because its not cheap to keep people in jail.
3	28050	25683	8	90	3	1	2	3	In the time that the death penalty was performed on a regular basis, the crime rate in society was at a lower level.	The crime rate was higher after the death penalty than before it.
2.666666667	14510	25683	52	67	3	8	10	3	If the execution rate decreased and the murder rate increased then that explains the deterrence effect of capital punishment.	The death penalty has never been shown to be a deterent to murder.
3.666666667	823	2104	8	48	1	4	5	1	Comparable countries without the death penalty have fewer murders then Texas.	Texas has the most executions and the most murders as well.
3.666666667	25683	5572	7	287	3	28	2	1	Many people argue that the death penalty is not a detterence.	And the argument of deterrence doesn't oblige either because how many people actually believe that people are NOT killing others because their afraid of getting the death penalty.
4.666666667	5572	5572	188	255	1	3	7	1	It seems that those that would be deterred by fear of punishment are already dettered by the threat of a life sentence.	I suppose that, for most people, having to serve a life sentence without parole would already ruin their life enough that any who would be detered by fear of punishment are already detered.
2	30812	15556	22	12	3	3	2	3	So I think it is better to imprison those who deserve death for life, rather than even once as a people murder the wrong person.	The way I see it people who murder shouldn't be sentenced to death or spend life in the jails we have here there to nice.
2	33045	28050	35	39	3	4	6	3	"The question of whether death sentence should be allowed to continue or not, is therefore dependent upon the society and in general a society that has evolved as a ""civilized"" society would not need such punishments."

1	28050	823	130	9	3	0	1	1	If that is the case I am against Capital Punishment.	What I meant was that the chance of being wrongly convicted for a capital case is far less than the change of being struck by lightning.
3	25683	14127	73	35	3	3	7	3	Well according to your own paper, it says that you can't prove that the death penalty increases the murder rate.	If there was another factor associated with the increase in the murder rate and not the death penalty, then the article itself would have pointed it out.
1.666666667	22346	31664	17	30	3	0	1	3	I say that they should be killed the same way that the person(s) that they killed were.	Like I said I would just want them to actually have to deal with the consequences and not get an easy out, which is what executing them does.

1	31664	1676	52	16	3	6	0	1	In a case like this, we can assume that the alternative is life in prison.	As long as we sentence people to a life in prison we are also GUARANTEED to sentence an innocent person.
1.333333333	31664	22346	54	7	3	1	1	3	And the purpose of the death penalty is not to punish, but to deter further crime.	The truth is that the Death Penalty punishes those who have convicted a crime of extreme severity, not any criminal who commits a crime.
1	7933	17	265	25	1	3	5	1	And because Christ forgave the men that unjustly killed him does not conclusivly show that He was against the death penalty.	So what does he have to do with a debate like this about murderers and the death penalty?
2.666666667	7933	4756	314	4	1	2	10	1	A perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people, and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty.	Some innocent people are still sentenced to death, and that's where I see a problem.
1	2659	5304	31	14	1	4	3	1	If it is not, then we should not be putting people on trial for murder.	That doesn't ensure that we don't end up murdering innocent people.
1.333333333	31664	1128	9	42	3	0	1	1	"And no one said that life in prision is ""much worse"" then the death penalty."	So your argument is that if the death penalty was cheaper than life in prison it would have the advantage of being cheaper than life in prison.
1.333333333	30812	30812	111	22	3	0	3	3	The way I see it people who murder shouldn't be sentenced to death or spend life in the jails we have here there to nice.	I think people suffer more when they spend their whole lives in jail.
3.333333333	28050	17	202	122	3	25	1	1	But are there any stats available showing countries/states with the death penalty have a higher/lower crime rate?	States without the death penalty have fared BETTER in reducing their murder rates than states with the death penalty.
1	7933	14127	2	74	1	6	3	3	At the end of the day the killer is being punished for ending a life.	With trials and appeals, one execution can end up costing more than a life sentence by the time the execution is actually carried out.

1	5572	7933	36	40	1	19	1	1	So as long as only some innocent people are killed for crimes they didn't commit then the system must be sound.	We shouldn't just kill someone if they commit a crime.
1.333333333	12024	31664	1	25	3	1	3	3	I don't think anyone has been put the death for third degree murder either.	I don't think everyone should be put to death.

1.666666667	4774	15556	53	12	1	9	2	3	So I think it is better to imprison those who deserve death for life, rather than even once as a people murder the wrong person.	As it is today, when someone murderers another, the death penalty is considered, as it should be.
2.333333333	4756	30812	34	48	1	6	1	3	For some people death penalty is better than life in prison, who are respect their freedom and who are consider that it is better to die than someone to judge them.	The comparison is no bridge to the death penalty, however, because there is nothing gained by seeing a person fried to death as opposed to seeing them fade away in a prison cell for the rest of their life.

1	4774	18153	32	22	1	1	10	3	Should the abuser be put to death, that would be to good for him.	In fact, I think if Jesus did not believe in the death penalty, it would make his sacrifice that much greater, because he would be being unjustly put to death.

1.333333333	4690	15556	202	12	1	0	2	3	So I think it is better to imprison those who deserve death for life, rather than even once as a people murder the wrong person.	"If I ever ""murder"" someone without cause, I would deserve to die."
5	25683	25683	88	99	3	27	0	3	Implementing the death penalty will send a message to others that no one should have the right to kill another person.	The death penalty again, in giving punishing the offender sends out a message to others that no one should kill or hurt another person which will thus serve to deter other potential killers.
1.333333333	4690	31664	76	27	1	3	6	3	It wouldn't shock me if someone committed murder JUST to get those things.	...and if I do someday murder someone, I should be killed.
3.666666667	4690	31664	32	52	1	1	6	3	As long as we sentence people to a life in prison we are also GUARANTEED to sentence an innocent person.	So should we be able to impose the sentence of life without parole, all the while understanding that we may have put an innocent man in prison for life?
1.666666667	25683	15556	112	12	3	6	2	3	So I think it is better to imprison those who deserve death for life, rather than even once as a people murder the wrong person.	I think only certain people deserve to have the death penalty.
2.666666667	22346	33045	7	71	3	1	0	3	Yes, the death penalty should be use as a punishment.	And the purpose of the death penalty is not to punish, but to deter further crime.
2.666666667	13526	4690	8	90	3	7	0	1	As far as I know, you may as well ACTUALLY believe any number of things, if you actually believe in the death penalty.	So all in all I believe in the death penalty.
4	31664	4690	54	32	3	1	18	1	The death penalty is simply a legally imposed punishment given to felons who commited crimes for which the death penalty is applicable.	The truth is that the Death Penalty punishes those who have convicted a crime of extreme severity, not any criminal who commits a crime.
3	1676	1676	59	49	1	6	2	1	IE - the death penalty acts as a deterrent to other would be murderers.	The death penalty is not deterrance for the person executed.
3	25683	28050	84	210	3	4	0	3	If the death penalty deters murder (as you claim) then why does Europe have a lower murder rate even though they've outlawed the death penalty?	Therefore, people will think twice before they choose to commit a crime and also, the death penalty has been proven to deter the crime rate.
1.333333333	823	373	9	28	1	8	3	1	Oh, and by the way, the criteria that I mentioned earlier was enough to kill someone for treason, so why shouldn't it be enough to kill someone for another crime?	If someone were to torture and kill one of my kids, I don�۪t think killing them would be punishment enough.
1.333333333	7933	5572	2	226	1	12	0	1	Oh there are about a hundred things I can think of that make the death penalty look like a day in the park.	In any case, while I believe some criminals should just be carried into the street and shot, I don't think the death penalty is worth it in today's society.
3.333333333	3065	2358	52	40	1	0	1	1	Like everyone, I morn Laci Peterson's passing, but I am opposed to the death penalty for many reasons.	I am very conservative and I am opposed to abortion and the death penalty.
1.333333333	25683	33045	84	90	3	4	0	3	I think that if the murderer wants the death penalty, they should be allowed it if the victim's family agrees- but for crimes of passion and misunderstanding, no death penalty.	Therefore, people will think twice before they choose to commit a crime and also, the death penalty has been proven to deter the crime rate.
1	1676	2358	59	1	1	6	1	1	Peterson could face the death penalty or life without parole.	The death penalty is not deterrance for the person executed.
4.333333333	5572	5572	255	222	1	5	10	1	Statistics show that capital punishment is no more of a deterrent than life without parole so I fail to see your arguement about society needing capital punishment.	But the statistics don't support the idea that the death penalty is any more effective as a detterent than is a life sentence.
1	3065	373	23	3	1	5	0	1	Darknight, This is a good point that I agree with and another Pro for capital punishment.	Although there is much controversy about him, I agree that prisons, especially for those for whom the death penalty could be considered, should be punishment.
2.333333333	14127	28050	50	20	3	1	0	3	I assume in what follows that we, the country or the state, execute only for the crime of murder, though many capital punishment adherents would use it for other crimes, such as child rape, treason, arson, robbery and even fraud.	I believe that people who have killed, raped, tortured, or have done any other extreme act of violence should get the death penalty.
1.333333333	4690	17	4	25	1	0	5	1	And because Christ forgave the men that unjustly killed him does not conclusivly show that He was against the death penalty.	Ask the family members of who he killed if he deserves death.
1.333333333	3065	2652	52	30	1	0	9	1	All of the death penalty oppontents are for life in jail as opposed to the death penalty.I am sure that if some are found innocent,there are at least that many that are innocent and never set free.	I am very conservative and I am opposed to abortion and the death penalty.
2.666666667	2659	2659	31	20	1	4	6	1	Getting rid of the expensive appeals basically ensures that more innocent people will die.	That doesn't ensure that we don't end up murdering innocent people.
1.333333333	1676	3065	22	107	1	5	1	1	My only issue with the death penalty is the case of innocence, however there has been no innocent put to death in the united states since 1976, there has been claims but these have all been dismissed.	There are some who need to be put to death.
1.333333333	1128	14510	16	63	1	3	0	3	that is why I support it for serial killers, I don't really support it for a murderer.	But as long as they are only options, I support the criminals right to choose that particular method.
1.666666667	32744	32744	25	3	3	1	0	3	No, if it is already known that this person made the crime, the death penalty may be used.	You have just shown your position why we should use the death penalty, but i have not seen the solution for people who are making crime?
1	823	14127	1	39	1	6	4	3	Well, I'm assuming the one with the most lasting effects (death penalty).	Personally I am more interested in the deterrent effect of capital punishment over the punishment aspect.
1	17	7933	25	250	1	5	0	1	No he the guy who killed twitter should have to suffer in jail and think about what he done for the rest of his life, and not be given the easy way out buy the death pentaly.	And because Christ forgave the men that unjustly killed him does not conclusivly show that He was against the death penalty.
2.666666667	30812	1676	112	16	3	0	6	1	I think it could be proven that putting somebody in prison for life whent ehy have requested the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment.	I dont think staying in prison for life is more punishment.
2	1676	18153	22	22	1	5	10	3	Should the abuser be put to death, that would be to good for him.	There are some who need to be put to death.
3.333333333	13175	22346	2	25	3	0	0	3	There are many reasons the death penalty should be abolished.	The first reason of abolishing the death penalty is human rights perspectives and the danger of executing innocent people .
1.666666667	7933	7933	228	11	1	5	0	1	Though I would not call the death penalty murder, I am personally against it.	Besides I'm not saying we should apply the death penalty in all instances of murder for example.
3	25683	5572	90	196	3	1	7	1	States without the death penalty generally have lower murder rates.	The murder rate for the state of New York, a state without the death penalty has increased this year with a higher rate of murder than it was in 2009.
2	20886	25683	23	112	3	0	6	3	I think only certain people deserve to have the death penalty.	I don't think the death penalty should be banned.
4.333333333	28050	28050	37	68	3	9	8	3	Not to mention that the death penalty is more costly than simple life in prison in both money and time.	Living in jail for life costs less money then the death penalty.
2.333333333	28050	14510	64	37	3	2	13	3	A life sentence does not prevent a murderer from murdering again.	Killing the criminal would just make others angry, since there are other ways to take criminals out of the streets, like life sentences.
3.666666667	28050	28050	215	213	3	2	0	3	Look violence rates of ALL kinds are lower outside of the USA in countries with no death penalty, period.	Also, within the USA, murder rates are consistently lower in states that don't have capital punishment.
2.333333333	28050	13175	45	22	3	0	0	3	I think the death penalty should only be used in extreme cases where the accused is, without a doubt, guilty.	The death penalty is not used for what it is supposed to be used for.
1.333333333	12024	5572	1	24	3	1	1	1	This is why I said what I said in the first place about why I'm against the death penalty.	I don't think everyone should be put to death.
1	3065	22346	95	30	1	0	10	3	(4)Death penalty does not intimidate people from committing a crime.	i think the death penalty should be abolished because some people are sentenced to deathfor a crime they might have not committed.
3	28050	28050	8	215	3	1	2	3	Also, within the USA, murder rates are consistently lower in states that don't have capital punishment.	The crime rate was higher after the death penalty than before it.
2.333333333	4690	8212	62	16	1	13	11	3	The death penalty is in place to prevent further crimes, not to please the victim's family.	Both the death penalty and a life sentence would have prevent further murders.
1	12024	5572	14	39	3	0	14	1	Only if they try to murder somebody after they are in prison do they deserve the death penalty?	The problem with the death penalty is eventually someone will be sentenced to death when they are in fact guilty.
4	28050	5572	34	196	3	1	6	1	Most people who would be deterred already seem to be deterred by life without parole as a punishment.	Does the death penalty deter evil more than life in prison?
3	17	5572	124	262	1	0	6	1	"Until then, I remain unmoved by their cries of ""innocent people"" being put to death."	I would support the death penalty IF there was a way to ensure that it would not put innocent people to death.
1.333333333	25683	15556	110	12	3	0	2	3	So I think it is better to imprison those who deserve death for life, rather than even once as a people murder the wrong person.	I see no point in letting someone live who does not want to live, or letting someone die who does not want to die.
3	28237	20886	8	23	3	7	3	3	Hellno is right, capital punishment should be much more cost effective than the alternative- life in prison without parole.	Life imprisonment without parole is more effective than execution, and it is cheaper.
3	4756	28050	62	1	1	15	6	3	People have, and will, be executed even though they are innocent of the crime.	If somebody is completely innocent and they are executed for a crime they didn't commit (which, with forensics these days, probably will never happen again), that is a problem.
1	25683	17	77	44	3	0	5	1	"The death penalty was included in that ""law."""	The Death Penalty is a subject i am very passionate about and i am also pursuing the study of criminal law so it has exposed me to many facts.
2	25683	4690	26	119	3	0	11	1	The death penalty doesn't reverse the death of the victim.	IMO the death penalty is about justice for the loved ones of the victims.
2.666666667	5572	5572	251	255	1	0	1	1	If I heard of an innocent stranger being brutally killed, I might want to see the perpetrator suffer because of the suffering of the victim - that is VENGEANCE pure and simple.	Since I am not related to any death-row-inmate's victims (of murder, rape, molestation), I do not classify my desire to see them dead as vengeance.
1.333333333	1676	1128	78	23	1	12	2	1	If they don't want to kill an innocent person, stick to life in prison.	If someone killed my relative, I wouldn't want them killed, I would want them to spend the rest of their lives in hard, back breaking labor.
2.333333333	4690	4690	62	149	1	9	2	1	Bleeding hearts will not accept the fact that the death penalty is a deterrent and saves innocent lives.	If it has nothing to do with the death penalty, how could it have anything to do with lives saved by the death penalty in the first place?
1	28050	373	64	2	3	0	5	1	If we slap a guarantueed death penalty on murder then any following murderer commits the crime on pain of death which is a much better detterent.	If we continue to allow the death penalty, we are no better than the murderers and rapists that we punish with the death penalty.
4.333333333	28050	13175	84	22	3	12	0	3	I think the death penalty should only be used in extreme cases where the accused is, without a doubt, guilty.	I dont think the death penalty should be apllied in just any case.
1	5572	14127	275	60	1	28	22	3	You can't just assume the death penalty is a crime.	Just because you can be rehabiliated, the crime you may have done may have been so henius that society demands your removal, but not death.
3	5572	33045	230	37	1	1	42	3	I said that the definition and what I said are the same, because the one who is being rehabilitated is still being punished with suffering or pain and it is accomplishing the goal of them learning right from wrong.	Rehabilitation is one goal that one has for punishment but other goals might include:
2.666666667	4774	17	32	25	1	1	5	1	And because Christ forgave the men that unjustly killed him does not conclusivly show that He was against the death penalty.	In fact, I think if Jesus did not believe in the death penalty, it would make his sacrifice that much greater, because he would be being unjustly put to death.
4.333333333	5572	18153	50	52	1	1	2	3	First it is more expensive to kill a person, then letting him stay for a life long imprisonment.	The death penalty (because of appeals) costs more than solitary confinement for life, both of which would ensure that the person would never kill again.
1.333333333	5572	1676	260	21	1	1	21	1	With all that it has been a very trying time for me and I have had to struggle with how I really felt about the death penalty.	This is why I'm aganist the penalty as punishment.
1	13293	3271	16	27	3	0	5	1	I think at least if they are innocent they would be happier as I am living without that safety net than being killed because we don't think they should have a right to fight for thier lives leagally.	I don't believe that they should because if you kill someone, they won't have the chance to either get rehabilitated nor will they have the chance to actually regret what they have done.
3	28050	5572	36	196	3	1	6	1	Most people who would be deterred already seem to be deterred by life without parole as a punishment.	The death penalty is sometimes claimed to save lives through deterrence.
3.333333333	28050	3065	46	108	3	3	116	1	The death penalty demeans the moral order and execution does something	the death penalty also is premediated murder,it demeans the state and makes society more violent!
2	5572	1128	181	50	1	3	0	1	If you get a life sentence, you shouldn't have any choices whatsoever.	In fact, with the death penalty you get more due process than someone with a life sentence...there aren't many advocates for helping those guys out.
3.333333333	30812	14510	111	29	3	0	2	3	The government shouldnt make people spend the rest of their life in prison or jail because that would be a cruel and unusual punishment.	I think people suffer more when they spend their whole lives in jail.
3	4690	1676	185	35	1	27	4	1	Therefore the argument of death as a deterent is a joke.	Furthermore, any assertion that the death penalty is not a deterrent is false.
1.333333333	1676	31664	22	61	1	5	26	3	If the death penalty is not administered equally, those who have been put to death have been treated UNFAIRLY.	There are some who need to be put to death.
1.333333333	28050	28050	113	64	3	1	2	3	Killing the criminal would just make others angry, since there are other ways to take criminals out of the streets, like life sentences.	The people dying from the death penalty are guilty people who have taken the lives of others.
1	3065	2104	88	48	1	5	5	1	Comparable countries without the death penalty have fewer murders then Texas.	abortion does not qualify as state murder like the death penalty.
3	32744	5572	28	145	3	1	9	1	As far as the deterrent argument, I have said this before, and I will say it again: There is no accurate way to measure if the death penalty is deterring crime or not.	I've followed this debate for years (I work in a prison), and i have never heard it suggested by anyone other than those who oppose the Penalty, that the Penalty is a deterrent.
4	5572	3271	188	52	1	0	8	1	I am responding.....you seem to think thatg life in prison is worse then the death penalty........I am telling you that the prisoners on death row would disagree........	I think that criminals view the death penalty as worse than life imprisonment and worse than temporary solitary confinement within life imprisonment - at least given the conditions in American prisons.
2.333333333	32744	17	10	136	3	3	1	1	So we kill killers, but in the end, end up with more murders.	How can you justify teaching a generation of children that to stop killers from killing because killing is wrong, we should kill them?

5	28237	13175	29	22	3	1	0	3	I think the death penalty should only be used in extreme cases where the accused is, without a doubt, guilty.	but yes only in extreme cases, and only if we can prove the person is guilty without a doubt.
3	28050	13175	115	18	3	0	3	3	If a person just raped someone (this is just an example) they shouldn't be killed for it, but something like a mass murdering or serial killing should be dealt with by putting them to death.	If someone is bad enough to be considered for the death penalty then they must have had sure evidence that they are guilty if they are then they shouldn't deserve the right to live among people they could kill
1	31664	9676	65	6	3	0	1	1	A trial is how we determine whether someone has done something wrong.	Actually we still kill the wrong person all the time.

3.666666667	30812	30812	111	48	3	0	1	3	For some people death penalty is better than life in prison, who are respect their freedom and who are consider that it is better to die than someone to judge them.	I think people suffer more when they spend their whole lives in jail.
3	17	14510	64	37	1	2	13	3	A life sentence does not prevent a murderer from murdering again.	If someone keeps killing and killing and killing, we need to stop him from taking lives.
2.666666667	30812	14510	92	29	3	1	2	3	The government shouldnt make people spend the rest of their life in prison or jail because that would be a cruel and unusual punishment.	but spending whole life in jail would be a better punishment
2.666666667	4756	3065	96	67	1	1	0	1	How do you compare killing a little child who has never had the chance to live to the execution of a criminal who has been raping and killing little children?	There are no children being killed, and killing a child is murder in America.
4.666666667	5572	823	260	9	1	1	1	1	If that is the case I am against Capital Punishment.	This is why I'm aganist the penalty as punishment.
1	5572	14127	248	60	1	7	22	3	You can't just assume the death penalty is a crime.	If you accept vengeance as a reason for punishment then I understand why you would support the death penalty.
1	823	1676	16	89	1	5	3	1	Also, please explain how the Supreme Court can logically back up a claim that capital punishment is not a deterrent to capital crime.	Also, the dates of these crimes point to another point supporting capitol punishment.
1	7933	17	117	134	1	0	2	1	killing a person, no matter the reason, is still murder.	>_> Says the person who brought up freaking Nelson in a debate about the death penalty for murders.
3.333333333	14510	17	54	121	3	49	3	1	By the same token, if we keep administering the death penalty while the system is broken, we will have a much greater risk of putting someone innocent to death.	If we can not prevent the innocent from unjust punishment, we should not have the death penalty.
1	31664	15556	27	15	3	6	3	3	Some crimes are so heinous that the person who committed the crime deserves to die: I would only agree to this if the execution erased the crime that was committed in the first place.	It wouldn't shock me if someone committed murder JUST to get those things.
1	12024	13526	14	25	3	0	1	3	I personally would never wish death penalty on someone no matter what they did to me/family/friends I would just want them in jail for a life sentence because then the threat is pretty much over.	The problem with the death penalty is eventually someone will be sentenced to death when they are in fact guilty.
4.333333333	28050	4756	141	7	3	2	262	1	The Texas case of Lionel Herrera, like others, nationally, has been labeled, by many death penalty opponents, as an innocent executed.	Also, Texas has executed persons who were, in fact, innocent.
4.666666667	4690	4690	32	32	1	18	12	1	You may think of it as an arbitrary tit-for-tat policy, but I see it as a legal, court ordered punishment handed down by our judicial system for a crime to which the death penalty is applicable.	The death penalty is simply a legally imposed punishment given to felons who commited crimes for which the death penalty is applicable.
1.333333333	31664	4690	39	111	3	1	2	1	Among other things, what does it say about us as a society if we kill people who not only reform there own lives, but the lives of many others?	What if there were people killing other people, escaping from jail, doing it again etc.
2.333333333	4690	6937	152	32	1	2	2	1	Obviously, if someone were found innocent before execution, they would not be executed.	Even the people who did the study saying that innocents had been executed admitted that they cannot prove same.
3.666666667	25683	4690	89	62	3	25	13	1	Both the death penalty and a life sentence would have prevent further murders.	The death penalty has not been shown to be more effective than life imprisonment in deterring murder, hence we should choose life imprisonment.
1.333333333	31664	30812	24	108	3	1	0	3	I think instead of a death penalty, they should just stay in prison until they die because putting someone to death is just harsh, No matter who it is.	I also don't think someone has been put to death for a third degree murder.
3	7933	22346	310	7	1	0	1	3	And the purpose of the death penalty is not to punish, but to deter further crime.	The death penalty doesn't need to serve as a deterrent to crime.
1	17	25683	130	103	1	1	0	3	I believe that the final decision should be given to the bereaved; those affected by the murder.	There is no way to determine how many murders would have been committed.
1.666666667	28050	4690	188	32	3	8	17	1	No letting the family or friends of the victim kill the convicted person might be childish revenge.	That victim has a family, that is a father, brother, sister, mother, cousin.
1.333333333	14510	25683	49	81	3	0	0	3	Last time I checked, killing doesn't bring persons back to life, so the only reason for the death penalty seems to be revenge.	I'm also against death penalty because no one except God has the right to take person's life.
2	7933	18153	314	11	1	2	0	3	I think there should be a death penalty because, all those innocent people getting killed for no damn reason is unfair.	Some innocent people are still sentenced to death, and that's where I see a problem.
3.666666667	25683	4756	11	35	3	1	7	1	I firmly believe that some crimes and criminals are deserving of death.	I do feel that those who murder in cold blood would be more than deserving of the death penalty.
3.666666667	25683	31664	84	27	3	4	3	3	The thing is, without the death penalty there is absolutely no deterrent from committing heinous crimes.	Therefore, people will think twice before they choose to commit a crime and also, the death penalty has been proven to deter the crime rate.
1	3271	17	88	35	1	1	28	1	I fail to see how this proves that ���there is no question that Jesus was against the death penalty.�۝	The way I see it, capital punishment doesn't have to be expensive at all.
3	28050	28050	146	140	3	4	2	3	Texas' system of capital punishment is less than a quarter the cost of housing a criminal for life.	Life without parole costs the justice system WAAAY less than death penalty cases do.
1.666666667	4756	32744	96	10	1	1	3	3	How can you justify teaching a generation of children that to stop killers from killing because killing is wrong, we should kill them?	There are no children being killed, and killing a child is murder in America.
1.666666667	7933	4774	117	53	1	0	9	1	As it is today, when someone murderers another, the death penalty is considered, as it should be.	>_> Says the person who brought up freaking Nelson in a debate about the death penalty for murders.
1.333333333	30812	4774	48	53	3	1	9	1	As it is today, when someone murderers another, the death penalty is considered, as it should be.	For some people death penalty is better than life in prison, who are respect their freedom and who are consider that it is better to die than someone to judge them.
4.333333333	28050	20886	23	4	3	2	1	3	The government does not have the right to kill people.	Granted, someone, who bestows great harm onto a family for egregious acts, doesn't give the government the right to kill that person.
2	33642	7933	20	74	3	1	1	1	My point was that there are ways of dealing with violent criminals, murderers even, without executing them.	Criminals need to be punished for what they have done.
1.333333333	25683	28050	112	114	3	6	1	3	I agree that the people who are killed are mostly innocent people and that those killed by the death penalty are almost certainly guilty of the crime.	I think only certain people deserve to have the death penalty.
4	4756	4774	13	13	1	1	1	1	The death penalty executes felons found guilty of especially heinous crimes.	I support the death penalty because I feel that their are crimes and criminals so heinous that they deserve death.
1.333333333	28050	5572	115	39	3	0	14	1	Only if they try to murder somebody after they are in prison do they deserve the death penalty?	If someone is bad enough to be considered for the death penalty then they must have had sure evidence that they are guilty if they are then they shouldn't deserve the right to live among people they could kill
1	28050	2104	123	16	3	0	3	1	People who will commit a crime with life in prison would probably still commit the crime with capital punishment.	Many, many people have already been exonerated AFTER being convicted of a capital crime.
2.333333333	5572	30812	24	74	1	1	7	3	Like I said, I don't disagree with the theory of the death penalty.	This is why I said what I said in the first place about why I'm against the death penalty.
3.666666667	3186	25683	42	58	1	6	4	3	therefore the death penalty should not be used, simply because it kills innocent people.	Or you could merely ignore them and concede that the death penalty is flawed, kills innocent people and costs the lives of innocents in the use of how it is funded
2	28050	823	141	8	3	2	4	1	Texas has the most executions and the most murders as well.	Also, Texas has executed persons who were, in fact, innocent.
2.333333333	5065	5572	1	160	1	4	5	1	Show said criminal that their actions were unnacceptable to society, and therefore they must pay a penalty for their actions.	The death penalty is the only just punishment for their actions.
1.333333333	12024	5572	14	263	3	0	5	1	The person having been convicted of a crime punishable by death and subsequently sentenced to death should be put to death.	The problem with the death penalty is eventually someone will be sentenced to death when they are in fact guilty.
5	5572	4756	136	11	1	2	4	1	Again, I support the death penalty for certain crimes and criminals.	I believe there are certain crimes where the death penalty is an acceptable punishment.
2	5572	33045	200	35	1	11	4	3	The question is should the death penalty be allowed as a form of punishment.	The question with the death penalty is not kill or give no punishment.
4.333333333	28237	31664	10	56	3	9	14	3	In the United States, states without the death penalty has consistently lower murder rates.	Since murder is viewed as wrong, it generally makes more sense to eliminate the death penalty because murder rates are generally lower in those states.
1	33045	5572	38	24	3	21	1	1	This is why I said what I said in the first place about why I'm against the death penalty.	I don't even give a shit about the death penalty, I was just making a point.
3	5572	1128	188	42	1	0	1	1	"And no one said that life in prision is ""much worse"" then the death penalty."	I think that criminals view the death penalty as worse than life imprisonment and worse than temporary solitary confinement within life imprisonment - at least given the conditions in American prisons.
4.333333333	5572	17	265	128	1	0	1	1	If we don't stop the death penalty now, we will put innocent people to death while we try to fix the problems.	So how about we stop a penalty that has executed innocents?
3	28050	5572	8	196	3	1	7	1	States without the death penalty generally have lower murder rates.	The crime rate was higher after the death penalty than before it.
1.333333333	6937	25683	28	7	1	1	27	3	There is no reason to give that person a death penalty.	The reasons given most often for supporting the death penalty are emotional reasons of retribution for the heinous acts of the criminal.
4.666666667	28050	31664	202	56	3	25	14	3	In the United States, states without the death penalty has consistently lower murder rates.	States without the death penalty have fared BETTER in reducing their murder rates than states with the death penalty.
3.333333333	25683	25683	53	53	3	22	23	3	Whereas, if we choose not to use executions and there is a general deterrent effect, we would be sacrificing innocent lives.	First, we must choose to use executions because they may save innocent life.
2.333333333	4774	33045	8	71	1	11	0	3	Yes, the death penalty should be use as a punishment.	God gave to government the legitimate authority to use capital punishment to restrain murder and to punish murderers.
1.666666667	3065	14510	76	24	1	2	2	3	if someone killed you wouldn't you want them dead?	But why do you have to get rid of them by killing them.
2.666666667	4690	33642	87	1	1	9	0	3	If murder is wrong than so is the death penalty.	Life is a precious thing (after all, you're proposing the death penalty because of killing) and even ONE incorrect execution is one too many.
2.333333333	4690	33045	32	71	1	18	0	3	Yes, the death penalty should be use as a punishment.	The death penalty is simply a legally imposed punishment given to felons who commited crimes for which the death penalty is applicable.
3	25683	31664	90	56	3	1	14	3	In the United States, states without the death penalty has consistently lower murder rates.	The murder rate for the state of New York, a state without the death penalty has increased this year with a higher rate of murder than it was in 2009.
1.333333333	4690	7933	76	62	1	3	7	1	I have been a victim of rape and if I were a victim of murder I would not desire the death penalty for the perpetrator.	...and if I do someday murder someone, I should be killed.
1.666666667	14510	14510	49	20	3	0	5	3	Someone in my family, honestly I would want that person to take the death penalty.	I'm also against death penalty because no one except God has the right to take person's life.
2.666666667	5572	28050	136	66	1	2	0	3	I think the death penalty is an archaic and obsolete form of punishment, even for the crime of murder.	I believe there are certain crimes where the death penalty is an acceptable punishment.
1	33045	30812	38	74	3	21	7	3	Like I said, I don't disagree with the theory of the death penalty.	I don't even give a shit about the death penalty, I was just making a point.
3	7933	3271	56	118	1	1	4	1	Even though you deny it, your statements show you have no problem executing innocent people.	Especially given that you have accepted that some innocent people are executed.
2	5572	7933	181	256	1	1	2	1	The antepenultimate man to be sentenced to death was innocent.	How many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent?
2.666666667	31664	3065	30	23	3	1	1	1	But I can't get past the fact that they'll be killed for killing someone else - it's hypocritical.	I say that they should be killed the same way that the person(s) that they killed were.
4.333333333	25683	14510	89	52	3	25	8	3	The death penalty has never been shown to be a deterent to murder.	The death penalty has not been shown to be more effective than life imprisonment in deterring murder, hence we should choose life imprisonment.
1	4690	14127	87	75	1	16	4	3	We must look into why the person raped a child or murdered a father.	We could get the person who may kill in the future.
2	30812	13293	36	12	3	0	2	3	No one who committed such an act should get the easy way out with death.	Death penalty are given to those who have comitted a very serious crime.
1.333333333	28050	9872	3	23	3	4	15	1	Is it reason to do away with the death penalty?	There is no reason that the death penalty, in general, should be more expensive than LWOP and, in many, if not most cases, the death penalty should be less expensive.
1	4774	13526	32	8	1	1	7	3	So all in all I believe in the death penalty.	In fact, I think if Jesus did not believe in the death penalty, it would make his sacrifice that much greater, because he would be being unjustly put to death.
1.333333333	31664	9872	17	23	3	0	15	1	Is it reason to do away with the death penalty?	The reason to be for the death penalty is because it is just; the same foundation of support for all sanctions.
1	28050	3271	178	88	3	0	1	1	The way I see it, capital punishment doesn't have to be expensive at all.	The death penalty right now is to easy even I think.
2.333333333	25683	28050	58	114	3	0	1	3	I agree that the people who are killed are mostly innocent people and that those killed by the death penalty are almost certainly guilty of the crime.	But I oppose the death penalty because it has the capacity to kill innocent people.
3	28050	22346	105	30	3	1	10	3	(4)Death penalty does not intimidate people from committing a crime.	, I believe the death penalty has deterred at least some people from committing murder.
3	4756	30812	11	93	1	4	0	3	For sheer purposes of punishing a criminal, I don't support the death penalty.	Again, I support the death penalty for certain crimes and criminals.
3	4690	2104	147	30	1	1	5	1	So in reality, pushing the death penalty only ensures that more innocent people will be murdered.	Exactly how many innocent people has the death penalty killed?
2	30812	18153	112	16	3	0	1	3	I dont believe that someone who killed or raped a lot of people should be able to live even if they are in a jail surrounded by other criminals.	I dont think staying in prison for life is more punishment.
2.333333333	7933	28050	40	151	1	1	11	3	The studies are very clear that people are routinely convicted of crimes that they never committed, period.	So as long as only some innocent people are killed for crimes they didn't commit then the system must be sound.
1.333333333	2659	4690	39	59	1	0	12	1	I will agree that the death penalty is too arbitrarily applied.	I used to be for the death penalty, however two things made me question my position.
1.333333333	5065	25683	1	67	1	16	12	3	If there was another factor, then there would have already been arguments against this study using other studies produced by the opponents of the death penalty to proved this theory wrong.	Others have said that the death penalty is biblically wrong.
2	28050	31664	42	25	3	0	0	3	I believe that murder is the killing of a human being.	I think America should ban the death penalty because no man/woman has the right to kill anyone even if the have done something wrong, because i believe that only God should have the power to take people's lives.
2.333333333	4774	31664	8	25	1	11	2	3	Death penalty is then in this case a lawful murder.	God gave to government the legitimate authority to use capital punishment to restrain murder and to punish murderers.
2.333333333	33642	25683	21	91	3	0	23	3	Quite a lot of people think that criminals should be punished for the sake of punishing them, whether or not it deters anyone; I had thought you were one of them.	I am not disagreeing with punishing criminals for crimes they have committed.
1.333333333	30812	33045	46	75	3	6	2	3	Once the danger is gone killing a person is simply murder.	No one asks a murderer if killing a person for wearing pink feels like killing a person that has killed another... It may be equally as justified.
3	28050	14127	210	35	3	0	7	3	Well according to your own paper, it says that you can't prove that the death penalty increases the murder rate.	If the death penalty deters murder (as you claim) then why does Europe have a lower murder rate even though they've outlawed the death penalty?
3	31664	31664	40	56	3	0	13	3	Aside from the true moral standpoint of avoiding killing innocent people and ignoring the greater good aspect of the death penalty, the legal system is wrong because the death penalty has no deterrence.	Death penatly is not just about money, but it is morally wrong.
2	5572	25683	50	86	1	1	31	3	Can life imprisonment for a definite yes, prevent a murderer from killing again?	The death penalty (because of appeals) costs more than solitary confinement for life, both of which would ensure that the person would never kill again.
1.666666667	1676	30697	72	19	1	4	0	3	The dealth penalty is not as simple as it seems.	So, seems to me that when you make death a quick (as in timely) and certain punishment, there is most definitely a deterent effect.
1.333333333	25683	28050	86	64	3	31	2	3	Killing the criminal would just make others angry, since there are other ways to take criminals out of the streets, like life sentences.	Can life imprisonment for a definite yes, prevent a murderer from killing again?
2.333333333	14127	14127	60	60	3	33	27	3	Saying the death penalty is a justified method of punishment for a crime just because the criminal is a killer himself is a completely contrived reason.	Why is that not a completely contrived, arbitrary excuse to act just as bad as the criminal?
1.333333333	3065	5572	23	260	1	5	1	1	This is why I'm aganist the penalty as punishment.	Although there is much controversy about him, I agree that prisons, especially for those for whom the death penalty could be considered, should be punishment.
2.666666667	28050	25683	35	42	3	0	15	3	Even if the death penalty does not deter serial killers, it prevents them from killing again in society or in prison.	The death penalty is useless deterrent of crime because in the states that have them, they are not any more inclined to commit a crime because the threat of death penalty particularly if it is murder.
1	2659	30812	39	35	1	0	0	3	I'd rather be put to death than sit in a jail cell and rot for the rest of my life.	I used to be for the death penalty, however two things made me question my position.
2	3065	5572	13	216	1	0	9	1	I would say that we need to keep cold-blooded barbarism out of our justice system at all levels.	Like I said no criminal justice system is perfect......
2.333333333	32744	18153	42	55	3	2	9	3	When a person does something horrible, we no longer see them as a human that values their life, we just see them as an epitome of hate.	If it must be, then we shall find a way to improve these peoples habits, not kill them because they aren't 'like us'.
1.333333333	3065	1676	23	78	1	1	12	1	If someone killed my relative, I wouldn't want them killed, I would want them to spend the rest of their lives in hard, back breaking labor.	But I can't get past the fact that they'll be killed for killing someone else - it's hypocritical.
2.666666667	28050	33642	139	1	3	0	1	3	You might say the criminal deserved it, but murder is murder, whether they deserved it or not.	just because someone is believed to have done something wrong doesnt mean that they are bad people who deserve to die...what if that happened to you?
1	25683	5572	28	130	3	1	24	1	If you are personally familiar with the hatred that accompanies a murderer, then you must know a victim's family member.	"Serial killers, ""How many people did you kill?"""
1.333333333	6937	14127	28	60	1	1	27	3	Saying the death penalty is a justified method of punishment for a crime just because the criminal is a killer himself is a completely contrived reason.	The reasons given most often for supporting the death penalty are emotional reasons of retribution for the heinous acts of the criminal.
1.333333333	7933	15556	40	6	1	1	3	3	if someone commits any crime, then they are a criminal by definition and should die.	So as long as only some innocent people are killed for crimes they didn't commit then the system must be sound.
1	4690	7836	78	11	1	3	4	3	"The debate question asks ""Should the death penalty be legalized?"""	An argument regarding the death penalty should be confined to discussions regarding those who have been wrongly convicted and sentenced to death.
1.333333333	373	6937	5	29	1	2	2	1	And no, I do not claim that there are trials that can determine innocence after execution...we hold those while they are alive, and before they are sentenced to death.	If we sentence someone to life in prison, we can always free them at a later time if they are found to be innocent.
3	1676	5572	35	145	1	4	9	1	As far as the deterrent argument, I have said this before, and I will say it again: There is no accurate way to measure if the death penalty is deterring crime or not.	Therefore the argument of death as a deterent is a joke.
2	25683	22346	85	7	3	13	1	3	And the purpose of the death penalty is not to punish, but to deter further crime.	There are multiple possible reasons for having a criminal justice system: deterring potential offenders, punishing actual offenders, rehabilitating offenders, removing offenders from the general population to prevent further criminality, avenging the victims of crime.
1.333333333	5572	1676	251	35	1	8	4	1	Therefore the argument of death as a deterent is a joke.	This argument has been made for the death penalty also.
4.333333333	4690	823	32	16	1	1	10	1	It is also possible for an innocent person to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, but nobody is making the argument to stop sending people to prison.	So should we be able to impose the sentence of life without parole, all the while understanding that we may have put an innocent man in prison for life?
1.666666667	4690	4690	62	47	1	9	0	1	If the same murderer had been given the death penalty, and never released in the first place, he would not be able to kill again.	If it has nothing to do with the death penalty, how could it have anything to do with lives saved by the death penalty in the first place?
4	5572	5572	184	184	1	23	24	1	If they are uncomfortable admitting that vengeance is the underlying reason, then perhaps they should re-think their stance on the death penalty.	Many people who support the death penalty are not willing to admit that vengeance plays a role - probably because they would be uncomfortable admiting that.
1.333333333	17	33045	32	63	1	36	3	3	If you support the death penalty and concede that an innocent man could be put to death, you must be willing to put your name in the hat, with every one else, to have the government execute you by mistake.	Well what is your decision on whether to support the death penalty?
2.666666667	4690	5572	32	266	1	0	7	1	Given the scrutiny of death penalty cases, it seems that we would be more likely to lock someone up for life in prison and never uncover their innocence than we are to execute an innocent person.	So if we can assume that innocent people are convicted in capital punishment cases, shouldn't we be free to assume that innocent people are being convicted in non-capital punishment cases as well?
1.333333333	28050	3065	208	107	3	9	0	1	I am a case by case pro, Some people simply need to be put to death for the crimes they have commited so that others are protected.	Nonsense, the issue of people being put to death for crimes that they likely NEVER committed is only one issue with the death penalty.
2	6937	22346	28	25	1	1	0	3	There are many reasons the death penalty should be abolished.	The reasons given most often for supporting the death penalty are emotional reasons of retribution for the heinous acts of the criminal.
4.333333333	15556	33045	3	68	3	2	3	3	Death penalty should be allowed for those who deserves it.	if it's murder then okay... the criminal deserves the death penalty.
1.666666667	14510	25683	54	53	3	49	23	3	Whereas, if we choose not to use executions and there is a general deterrent effect, we would be sacrificing innocent lives.	If we can not prevent the innocent from unjust punishment, we should not have the death penalty.
1	12024	28050	14	93	3	0	0	3	What does them being released have to do with the death penalty?	The problem with the death penalty is eventually someone will be sentenced to death when they are in fact guilty.
1.333333333	33642	33045	21	90	3	0	0	3	I think that if the murderer wants the death penalty, they should be allowed it if the victim's family agrees- but for crimes of passion and misunderstanding, no death penalty.	I am not disagreeing with punishing criminals for crimes they have committed.
3	3065	5065	108	1	1	60	22	1	There are also people who will tell you that the death penalty actually kills innocent people.	some of the innocent people that have been executed in the
2	13526	7933	8	244	3	7	5	1	And no, I don't the death penalty is murder.	So all in all I believe in the death penalty.
1.333333333	17	15556	135	12	1	1	2	3	So I think it is better to imprison those who deserve death for life, rather than even once as a people murder the wrong person.	If a person commits murder, I don't believe they deserve to live.
3.333333333	823	28050	12	203	1	1	0	3	"""We know for a FACT that innocent people have been put to death already""- then give me their names."	As of yet, we have not seen fact one that even one innocent person has been put to death.
2	25683	7933	11	244	3	1	5	1	And no, I don't the death penalty is murder.	I do feel that those who murder in cold blood would be more than deserving of the death penalty.
3	3065	3186	52	61	1	0	65	1	I'm against abortion and nominally for the death penalty.	I am very conservative and I am opposed to abortion and the death penalty.
1	4690	107	99	13	1	0	7	1	What does this have to do with the death penalty?	Acutally, long ago, the executioner was a convict also sentenced to death.
4.666666667	7933	28050	228	84	1	5	12	3	I dont think the death penalty should be apllied in just any case.	Besides I'm not saying we should apply the death penalty in all instances of murder for example.
3	13175	31664	14	25	3	4	2	3	Death penalty is then in this case a lawful murder.	The death penalty is not murder, it simply killing humanely and justifiably with a legitimate cause.
1.666666667	14127	4690	60	18	3	27	5	1	It is called the death penalty for a reason...it is a penalty, a punishment.	Saying the death penalty is a justified method of punishment for a crime just because the criminal is a killer himself is a completely contrived reason.

4	5572	823	265	36	1	0	34	1	We should not even have the death penalty just on the off chance that we might execute somebody who is innocent.	So how about we stop a penalty that has executed innocents?
2.666666667	15556	6937	3	36	3	2	1	1	Murder is murder and those who execute the death penalty are murderers as well.	if it's murder then okay... the criminal deserves the death penalty.
3.666666667	28050	5572	196	196	3	0	7	1	States without the death penalty generally have lower murder rates.	Most other first-world countries don't have the death penalty, but have lower rates of crime, just pointing that out.
1.333333333	15556	14127	3	60	3	2	24	3	The only difference between the death penalty and murder is that the government says it's okay to kill the criminal.	if it's murder then okay... the criminal deserves the death penalty.
3.666666667	28050	2104	203	34	3	19	0	1	There are many countries with lower murder rates than the U.S. and no death penalty.	Louisiana, a state with the death penalty and the highest murder rate in the country, has almost no gun control.
2	4756	14127	96	80	1	1	0	3	if a person kills another person it is murder, whether it is sanctioned by the state or not.	There are no children being killed, and killing a child is murder in America.
1	22346	4690	25	18	3	0	5	1	It is called the death penalty for a reason...it is a penalty, a punishment.	There are many reasons the death penalty should be abolished.
1	6937	107	5	13	1	6	7	1	What does this have to do with the death penalty?	in fact the ones against the death penalty ARE FOR ABORTION!
3.666666667	3271	14127	52	60	1	8	30	3	You can attempt say I'm being illogical, but you have yet to explain why the death penalty is preferable to imprisonment.	I am responding.....you seem to think thatg life in prison is worse then the death penalty........I am telling you that the prisoners on death row would disagree........
2	25683	17	11	64	3	1	5	1	There are a lot of people in jail for cold blooded murder, who did not get the death penalty.	I do feel that those who murder in cold blood would be more than deserving of the death penalty.
4.333333333	28050	5572	34	255	3	1	7	1	It seems that those that would be deterred by fear of punishment are already dettered by the threat of a life sentence.	Does the death penalty deter evil more than life in prison?
1	36893	14127	35	30	3	2	6	3	Because there's nothing to say that life imprisonment is a less harsh punishment.	Either way it will cost money, yet if the death penalty cut out some of it's steps it'd be less money than life imprisonment.
1.333333333	28237	8212	10	5	3	10	0	3	The majority populations of all countries may support the death penalty for some crimes (1).	The first twenty states with higher murder rates all have the death penalty.
4.333333333	28050	2659	37	24	3	22	3	1	The death penalty as a deterrent, our murder rate loudly speaks to that.	In addition, it is evident that the death penalty does not deter murder rates.
3.333333333	2652	13293	31	12	1	7	2	3	No one who committed such an act should get the easy way out with death.	And that killer has help, he has the people that support the death penalty and will give him more appeals, and if found guilty he'll get an easy way out with death, he won't have to suffer.
1.333333333	25683	373	50	44	3	1	16	1	As I mentioned, I feel that two witnesses to the crime(s) or a confession in court is sufficient.	I have evidence that says that innocent people are convicted of crimes.
2.333333333	25683	14127	90	35	3	33	7	3	Well according to your own paper, it says that you can't prove that the death penalty increases the murder rate.	The death penalty again has not only shown but proved to deter murder so therefore i wpuld suggest you reconsider your closing arguments.
1	2652	7933	31	265	1	7	3	1	So what does he have to do with a debate like this about murderers and the death penalty?	And that killer has help, he has the people that support the death penalty and will give him more appeals, and if found guilty he'll get an easy way out with death, he won't have to suffer.
1.333333333	28050	17	64	128	3	0	3	1	If we don't stop the death penalty before we try to fix it, the imperfect system will continue to convict innocent people while we determine what is best for it.	If we continue to allow the death penalty, we are no better than the murderers and rapists that we punish with the death penalty.
1.333333333	4690	17	87	136	1	16	1	1	So we kill killers, but in the end, end up with more murders.	We could get the person who may kill in the future.
4.333333333	5572	4690	136	44	1	2	0	1	Because we are all potential victims of violent crime, and I believe that there are violent crimes deserving of the death penalty.	I believe there are certain crimes where the death penalty is an acceptable punishment.
2.333333333	14510	1128	49	5	3	0	0	1	"I am ""for"" capital punishment... but if a criminal shows a desire for death over a life sentence, I prefer to be sadistic."	I'm also against death penalty because no one except God has the right to take person's life.
1	5572	5065	251	1	1	8	31	1	The final argument against the death penalty is that it is inhumane.	This argument has been made for the death penalty also.
4	28050	25683	182	112	3	1	6	3	I think only certain people deserve to have the death penalty.	Some people totally deserve the death penalty and I would hate it if they were released.
1.333333333	5304	14510	6	8	1	1	2	3	Firstly, life in prison is a worse punishment.Death penalty it is the simplest punishment for the person who e.g. killed, raped, committed act of terrorism and etc.	In all cases, the first punishment shouldn't be the death penalty.
2.333333333	5065	5304	1	6	1	4	1	1	In all cases, the first punishment shouldn't be the death penalty.	The death penalty is the only just punishment for their actions.
1.333333333	4690	4756	40	35	1	3	7	1	I firmly believe that some crimes and criminals are deserving of death.	If I could be satisfactorily convinced that a murderer had ZERO chance of committing another crime, I might be convinced to do away with the death penalty.
2.333333333	30812	20886	108	1	3	0	1	3	If I were charged to do something that forced me to spend the rest of my life in jail, I would rather die right now - I think they're doing the criminal a favor by putting him down.	I think instead of a death penalty, they should just stay in prison until they die because putting someone to death is just harsh, No matter who it is.
1.333333333	5572	4690	287	88	1	7	3	1	Only some states use the death penalty, only some countries allow the death penalty.	I would fear the death penalty very little in my home state due to the fact that it has only been used 3 times since 1976, and 228 inmates currently reside on death row.
1.333333333	3271	30812	52	74	1	8	7	3	Like I said, I don't disagree with the theory of the death penalty.	I am responding.....you seem to think thatg life in prison is worse then the death penalty........I am telling you that the prisoners on death row would disagree........
1.333333333	32744	6937	24	32	3	8	2	1	Obviously, if someone were found innocent before execution, they would not be executed.	Killing a person for them killing someone else ( I understand this is not necessarily the criteria for receiving the death penalty) makes you no better than the executed.
1.666666667	22346	20886	25	23	3	38	3	3	Hellno is right, capital punishment should be much more cost effective than the alternative- life in prison without parole.	In every state that retains the death penalty, jurors have the option of sentencing convicted capital murderers to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
2	18153	31664	55	25	3	1	0	3	I believe that murder is the killing of a human being.	I don't think preventing the death of more humans is idiocy.
3	32744	2104	21	16	3	1	3	1	People who will commit a crime with life in prison would probably still commit the crime with capital punishment.	I mean that if the death penalty would be legalized, people will scare to commit the crime.
3.666666667	4756	15556	11	14	1	4	3	3	The death penalty is about specific crimes, not any crimes.	Again, I support the death penalty for certain crimes and criminals.
1.333333333	30812	1676	36	26	3	0	2	1	The death of a criminal prevents him from committing any further crimes.	Death penalty are given to those who have comitted a very serious crime.
1.333333333	5572	25683	184	112	1	3	6	3	I think only certain people deserve to have the death penalty.	People generally think that the death penalty is worse than life without parole (certainly most criminals seem to think so).
1.333333333	17	13175	33	18	1	16	3	3	If a person just raped someone (this is just an example) they shouldn't be killed for it, but something like a mass murdering or serial killing should be dealt with by putting them to death.	An argument for putting people to death is so that they can never escape and kill again.
4	7933	28050	11	200	1	21	0	3	There is absolutely ZERO evidence that the death penalty deters crime.	Unless there can be solid uncontestable evidence shown that the death penalty is significant in deterring crime, this cannot be used as an argument for the death penalty.
4	4690	31664	32	52	1	0	6	3	As long as we sentence people to a life in prison we are also GUARANTEED to sentence an innocent person.	So if we can assume that innocent people are convicted in capital punishment cases, shouldn't we be free to assume that innocent people are being convicted in non-capital punishment cases as well?
1.666666667	32744	25683	11	112	3	8	6	3	I think only certain people deserve to have the death penalty.	I do not think this is harsh as the person who had done it deserves it.
1.666666667	31664	7933	46	62	3	0	7	1	I have been a victim of rape and if I were a victim of murder I would not desire the death penalty for the perpetrator.	One way that would make me happy with the death penalty is if the person was killed in the same way as the person that they murdered.
1.333333333	5572	7933	248	154	1	7	0	1	Since some of you seem to oppose the death penalty for one reason or another, and since I support it, we stand at an impass on this situation.	If you accept vengeance as a reason for punishment then I understand why you would support the death penalty.
1.333333333	14510	1128	64	23	3	1	2	1	If they don't want to kill an innocent person, stick to life in prison.	When they are about to be shot just think what would be happening, some unlucky person would be dealing with the fact that they were going to have to take someone's life.
3.333333333	5572	3271	221	52	1	3	8	1	I am responding.....you seem to think thatg life in prison is worse then the death penalty........I am telling you that the prisoners on death row would disagree........	You can't get much worse than a death penalty.
1.333333333	4690	15556	32	18	1	18	3	3	That should be a crime which should result in the death penalty.	The death penalty is simply a legally imposed punishment given to felons who commited crimes for which the death penalty is applicable.
1	30697	5572	27	181	3	1	1	1	How many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent?	First, it is more expensive than sentencing someone to life in prison.
2	33642	22346	21	10	3	0	3	3	Well I think that if someone commits a crime worthy of the death penalty they should get a sentence for life that way they can't be a repeat offender.	I am not disagreeing with punishing criminals for crimes they have committed.
4.333333333	5572	1676	140	35	1	0	4	1	Therefore the argument of death as a deterent is a joke.	The argument for the death penalty as a deterrent has been proved wrong by the implementation of it through history.
1.666666667	17	4756	134	62	1	4	49	1	Essentially, you believe a fetus should be allowed to be killed simply for existing, while you protect the lives of people who have murdered other innocent people (as murder is generally what a person will get the death penalty for).	By killing a person who murdered someone, you are just doing the same thing you are punishing him/her for.
4	28237	22346	2	7	3	0	1	3	And the purpose of the death penalty is not to punish, but to deter further crime.	The death penalty is the best possible deterrent for crime.
3.333333333	4690	373	18	31	1	2	3	1	No matter how well the justice system works, we will always risk convicting innocent people.	The notion that innocent people may be sentenced to death is not a death penalty problem, it is a judicial system problem.
1.333333333	30697	5572	10	86	3	16	0	1	I just think that if all non-volent offenders were out of jail then we'd have A LOT more room.	I KNOW IT COSTS A LOT TO KEEP AN INMATE IN PRISON.
1	17	25683	26	50	1	0	1	3	I have evidence that says that innocent people are convicted of crimes.	Oh I'm not saying that the govenrment should do away with the death penalty on these grounds, I'm saying that Christian people should oppose it, you said it yourself.
1.333333333	4690	32744	87	10	1	16	3	3	How can you justify teaching a generation of children that to stop killers from killing because killing is wrong, we should kill them?	We could get the person who may kill in the future.
3	32744	25683	42	101	3	2	14	3	If we kill our criminals, we see no opertunity for them to right their ways.	If it must be, then we shall find a way to improve these peoples habits, not kill them because they aren't 'like us'.
1	2659	30812	31	22	1	4	3	3	The way I see it people who murder shouldn't be sentenced to death or spend life in the jails we have here there to nice.	That doesn't ensure that we don't end up murdering innocent people.
4.333333333	28050	28050	37	210	3	22	0	3	If the death penalty deters murder (as you claim) then why does Europe have a lower murder rate even though they've outlawed the death penalty?	In addition, it is evident that the death penalty does not deter murder rates.
1.333333333	5572	1676	188	21	1	13	21	1	With all that it has been a very trying time for me and I have had to struggle with how I really felt about the death penalty.	I don't feel as strongly about the death penalty as I feel about the abortion rights debate since I can relate to the desire for vengeance that people feel.
4.666666667	5572	25683	222	85	1	10	9	3	Almost every study I've seen on the deterrent effect of the death penalty has suggested that it's no more effective than life imprisonment.	Statistics show that capital punishment is no more of a deterrent than life without parole so I fail to see your arguement about society needing capital punishment.
2	1676	2104	22	78	1	5	13	1	There is  no  social need for the Death Penality, so it ought not be used, since it only leads to more pain and suffereing.	There are some who need to be put to death.
1	30812	17	97	128	3	16	1	1	If we don't stop the death penalty now, we will put innocent people to death while we try to fix the problems.	Exactly the sort of person that we might want put to death by the justice system.
3.333333333	4774	7933	42	263	1	1	9	1	The French feel the death penalty is no longer necessary.	from a biblical perspective the death penalty is no longer necessary.
2	17	25683	108	87	1	0	31	3	I'm not saying we shouldn't do anything for the victims.	That right to life was taken away, I agree, but we will not accomplish anything if we kill someone else.
1	1128	13526	23	25	1	1	1	3	I personally would never wish death penalty on someone no matter what they did to me/family/friends I would just want them in jail for a life sentence because then the threat is pretty much over.	They shouldn't want to send an innocent person to prison for life either so it should have been pretty clear they were guilty already.
1.333333333	25683	13526	28	22	3	1	0	3	You say that all people who commit gruesome murders are psychopaths.	"Serial killers, ""How many people did you kill?"""
2	6937	31664	32	11	1	2	2	3	This process is needed in order to ensure that innocent men and woman are not executed for crimes they did not commit, and even with these protections the risk of executing an innocent person can not be completely eliminated.	Obviously, if someone were found innocent before execution, they would not be executed.
2	6937	30697	32	19	1	2	4	3	"This process is needed in order to ensure that innocent men and woman are not executed for crimes they did not commit, and even with these protections the risk of executing an innocent person can not be completely eliminated."""	Obviously, if someone were found innocent before execution, they would not be executed.
1.333333333	5572	1676	51	49	1	22	2	1	IE - the death penalty acts as a deterrent to other would be murderers.	There would be executions for murderers and jail time for others.
1.666666667	4690	15556	54	18	1	7	3	3	That should be a crime which should result in the death penalty.	While criminal trials not involving the death penalty can also involve mistakes, there is at least the opportunity for those mistakes to be corrected.
3	13293	33045	8	86	3	3	2	3	Besides, if someone raped and killed my daughter, I'd prefer they suffered the rest of their life in jail being man-raped by a bunch of rednecks and neo-nazi's than just be given the easy way out.	I'm not saying that a child's life is worth more than an adults, I'm saying if they killed any one they forfeit their life, because they in return lose what they took from someone else.
3.333333333	28050	28050	196	203	3	0	19	3	Louisiana, a state with the death penalty and the highest murder rate in the country, has almost no gun control.	Most other first-world countries don't have the death penalty, but have lower rates of crime, just pointing that out.

5	28050	14127	84	49	3	12	10	3	To summarize, I think the death penalty should be used, but only in extreme cases.	I dont think the death penalty should be apllied in just any case.
2.333333333	25683	25683	41	67	3	7	10	3	If the execution rate decreased and the murder rate increased then that explains the deterrence effect of capital punishment.	Which means that the execution rate may be low and still act as even more of a deterrent if publicity is increased.
2	3065	33642	76	1	1	2	1	3	You might say the criminal deserved it, but murder is murder, whether they deserved it or not.	But why do you have to get rid of them by killing them.
2	14510	4690	54	32	3	49	0	1	So if we can assume that innocent people are convicted in capital punishment cases, shouldn't we be free to assume that innocent people are being convicted in non-capital punishment cases as well?	If we can not prevent the innocent from unjust punishment, we should not have the death penalty.
1.333333333	28050	32744	203	3	3	18	0	3	No, if it is already known that this person made the crime, the death penalty may be used.	The death penalty has been used as a scapegoat for many people who are against executions.
1.333333333	15556	6937	15	76	3	9	0	1	Well lets see - we have had about 70 executions in the last few years, people held on death row.	Capital punishment frees up jail cells: Considering how few people we execute and how many new people enter the prison system each year, I do not see this as being a very good argument.
2	14127	18153	60	54	3	22	2	3	If you think there shouldn't be a death penalty, you're an idiot.	You can't just assume the death penalty is a crime.

2	25683	1128	53	23	3	22	2	1	If they don't want to kill an innocent person, stick to life in prison.	First, we must choose to use executions because they may save innocent life.
1.333333333	4690	4690	78	185	1	3	39	1	Those are the only relevant ones, seeing as my argument is that the death penalty should be changed to life imprisonment.	An argument regarding the death penalty should be confined to discussions regarding those who have been wrongly convicted and sentenced to death.
2.666666667	9676	7933	21	240	1	1	6	1	If you chose to kill someone who wasn't endangering your life at the moment you deserve to be killed.	You cannot kill somebody just because they've broken into your house, you have to have a well founded fear of harm.
1	5572	8200	154	20	1	5	2	3	Second reason is that prisoners, who committed very cruel crimes and have a life term punishment, shouldn't be provided by government.	All you have done is state a proclamation that all crimes must be punished, without giving any of your reasons behind that.
2	3065	7933	67	57	1	0	2	1	One of the many grievances I have is that child rapists don't qualify for the death penalty unless the child that gets raped is also killed.	How do you compare killing a little child who has never had the chance to live to the execution of a criminal who has been raping and killing little children?
1.333333333	28050	4690	113	111	3	1	2	1	Among other things, what does it say about us as a society if we kill people who not only reform there own lives, but the lives of many others?	The people dying from the death penalty are guilty people who have taken the lives of others.
1.333333333	4690	3186	90	5	1	0	0	1	"I certainly wouldn't count you as a friend, but I consider myself ""liberal"" in the way Americans use the term and yes I would oppose the death penalty in this case."	As far as I know, you may as well ACTUALLY believe any number of things, if you actually believe in the death penalty.
3	30812	33045	111	86	3	0	2	3	Besides, if someone raped and killed my daughter, I'd prefer they suffered the rest of their life in jail being man-raped by a bunch of rednecks and neo-nazi's than just be given the easy way out.	I think people suffer more when they spend their whole lives in jail.
4	17	5572	63	175	1	8	2	1	"So far, I am hearing ""an eye for an eye"" which is just that vengeance centered sense of justice that I am arguing against."	I know the eye for an eye statement is wrong.
1.333333333	14127	30697	50	23	3	1	5	3	However, as I know many disagree, I think there should be understandings for justifiable murders.	I believe that people who have killed, raped, tortured, or have done any other extreme act of violence should get the death penalty.
2.333333333	3271	33045	20	29	1	3	7	3	And sure it is at a cost to the taxpayer, but whether or not we execute someone should not be dependent upon the relative financial cost.	We wouldn't incur those legal fees , or the price of paying the bill for the person that has to do the killing.
1	5572	1676	271	80	1	16	33	1	Executing people is costing this country money, lives, and dignity.	And some people should be thrown away without being executed.
1.333333333	5572	8212	221	3	1	3	1	3	The death penalty is just such a sanction when considering the worste of all crimes.	You can't get much worse than a death penalty.
1	107	4690	2	18	1	8	3	1	And it seems that every time we start talking about the death penalty, that we end up talking about whether or not it deters crime.	Are we talking about what crimes are justifiably punished by death, or merely the validity of capital punishment as a Biblical measure?
2.333333333	28050	3065	121	30	3	0	2	1	A life sentence can be reversed if th convicted individual is later found innocent by new evidence.	so you weigh whatever monetary savings (if any) over the life of someone found innocent after conviction (even if rare)?
2.333333333	5572	18153	251	35	1	8	6	3	There are other, much stronger arguements against the death penalty.	This argument has been made for the death penalty also.
1	373	18153	5	55	1	2	9	3	When a person does something horrible, we no longer see them as a human that values their life, we just see them as an epitome of hate.	If we sentence someone to life in prison, we can always free them at a later time if they are found to be innocent.
3.333333333	5572	1128	201	23	1	3	1	1	They shouldn't want to send an innocent person to prison for life either so it should have been pretty clear they were guilty already.	There is an even smaller chance of an innocent person being sent to prison for the rest of their life, let alone to be convicted of a crime and sent to death.
3	25683	5572	102	192	3	7	1	1	Other countries not having it doesn't say anything about the morality of the death penalty.	Firstly, many people say that Europe does not have the death penalty so the U.S should not.
3.666666667	28050	2659	210	24	3	0	3	1	The death penalty as a deterrent, our murder rate loudly speaks to that.	If the death penalty deters murder (as you claim) then why does Europe have a lower murder rate even though they've outlawed the death penalty?
1.333333333	4690	4690	47	4	1	0	0	1	Ask the family members of who he killed if he deserves death.	If the same murderer had been given the death penalty, and never released in the first place, he would not be able to kill again.
1.666666667	25683	33045	85	37	3	14	42	3	I said that the definition and what I said are the same, because the one who is being rehabilitated is still being punished with suffering or pain and it is accomplishing the goal of them learning right from wrong.	Revenge and punishment I see as rather pointless; they impose suffering but give very few, if any, benefits.
1.666666667	4756	7933	5	256	1	3	2	1	The antepenultimate man to be sentenced to death was innocent.	My argument makes it clear that innocent people need not be sentenced to death in order for the death penalty to be unjust.
3.333333333	28050	28050	35	210	3	0	0	3	If the death penalty deters murder (as you claim) then why does Europe have a lower murder rate even though they've outlawed the death penalty?	The death penalty is useless deterrent of crime because in the states that have them, they are not any more inclined to commit a crime because the threat of death penalty particularly if it is murder.
4.333333333	5572	28050	140	200	1	0	0	3	There is absolutely ZERO evidence that the death penalty deters crime.	The argument for the death penalty as a deterrent has been proved wrong by the implementation of it through history.
2.333333333	18153	28050	16	64	3	1	2	3	Killing the criminal would just make others angry, since there are other ways to take criminals out of the streets, like life sentences.	I dont believe that someone who killed or raped a lot of people should be able to live even if they are in a jail surrounded by other criminals.
1.333333333	1676	4690	5	139	1	0	8	1	If we were 100% sure of guilt I may be more inclined to support the death penalty, although it still costs more.	If inmates in for life actually got life in 100% of the cases, I'd be more inclined to support a ban on capital punishment.
1	14510	13175	8	1	3	11	4	3	There have been numerous people who were presumed innocent after execution because the evidence showed that they were not guilty.	It is proved that death penalty for such kind people is the simplest punishment.
2	18153	31664	16	39	3	1	1	3	What if there were people killing other people, escaping from jail, doing it again etc.	I dont believe that someone who killed or raped a lot of people should be able to live even if they are in a jail surrounded by other criminals.
1	3271	13293	52	7	1	8	1	3	I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you, I do agree with the death penalty, but why should a child's life be worth more than any adult?	I am responding.....you seem to think thatg life in prison is worse then the death penalty........I am telling you that the prisoners on death row would disagree........
2.333333333	5304	7933	6	126	1	1	5	1	The death penalty is the only acceptable answer in this case.	In all cases, the first punishment shouldn't be the death penalty.
1.666666667	20886	1128	1	31	3	1	1	1	Anyway, with that I would actually favor allowing criminals to choose death as long as they choose death with no appeals.	If I were charged to do something that forced me to spend the rest of my life in jail, I would rather die right now - I think they're doing the criminal a favor by putting him down.
3	373	823	3	9	1	0	1	1	If that is the case I am against Capital Punishment.	Darknight, This is a good point that I agree with and another Pro for capital punishment.
4	3065	5572	52	260	1	0	1	1	This is why I'm aganist the penalty as punishment.	I am very conservative and I am opposed to abortion and the death penalty.
4	17	3271	128	39	1	3	3	1	The fact is that as long as we have a death penalty (the only Western nation to have it), we will execute innocents with the guilty.	If we don't stop the death penalty before we try to fix it, the imperfect system will continue to convict innocent people while we determine what is best for it.
1.333333333	3271	32744	118	25	1	4	1	3	You have just shown your position why we should use the death penalty, but i have not seen the solution for people who are making crime?	Even though you deny it, your statements show you have no problem executing innocent people.
2	4690	28050	32	123	1	0	0	3	Many, many people have already been exonerated AFTER being convicted of a capital crime.	So if we can assume that innocent people are convicted in capital punishment cases, shouldn't we be free to assume that innocent people are being convicted in non-capital punishment cases as well?
2.333333333	7933	8200	252	11	1	2	0	3	If there was no justifiable reason for the murder then I don't care who kills the bastard... the state or a civilian.	I am not a pacifist, so I am not opposed to all state-sanctioned killing.
1.666666667	5572	33045	268	90	1	30	0	3	I think that if the murderer wants the death penalty, they should be allowed it if the victim's family agrees- but for crimes of passion and misunderstanding, no death penalty.	The penalty is seen as vengence, why do they let families of the victims watch?
4.333333333	5572	5572	140	287	1	0	2	1	Many people argue that the death penalty is not a detterence.	The argument for the death penalty as a deterrent has been proved wrong by the implementation of it through history.
1.333333333	22346	2652	25	31	3	32	7	1	And that killer has help, he has the people that support the death penalty and will give him more appeals, and if found guilty he'll get an easy way out with death, he won't have to suffer.	Perhaps the most important factor in determining whether a defendant will receive the death penalty is the quality of the representation he or she is provided.
3	4756	7933	62	40	1	15	1	1	So as long as only some innocent people are killed for crimes they didn't commit then the system must be sound.	If somebody is completely innocent and they are executed for a crime they didn't commit (which, with forensics these days, probably will never happen again), that is a problem.
5	1676	28050	35	200	1	4	0	3	There is absolutely ZERO evidence that the death penalty deters crime.	Therefore the argument of death as a deterent is a joke.
1	5572	5572	221	302	1	3	0	1	So, in summary, you aren't against the death penalty on principle.	You can't get much worse than a death penalty.
3.666666667	4690	28050	12	200	1	0	0	3	There is absolutely ZERO evidence that the death penalty deters crime.	SO in turn, there is no clear evidence indicating that there is not a detterent value to the death penalty.
1.333333333	4690	31664	47	53	1	3	12	3	Odds are we are locking up more criminals than innocent victims.	If we fail to execute murderers, and doing so would in fact have deterred other murders, we have allowed the killing of a bunch of innocent victims.
2.333333333	373	3065	22	9	1	2	2	1	I'd be willing to give those already convicted and waiting on death row one more chance to show reasonable doubt of their guilt.	However, I think that the government needs to provide undeinable proof of their guilt in order to be able to sentence someone to death.
2.666666667	7933	32744	11	26	1	19	4	3	I feel as though you're implying that the death penalty is an effective crime deterrent.	The statistics about the effectiveness of the death penalty in deterring crimes are very mixed and seem inconclusive.
1	17	32744	33	42	1	17	2	3	If it must be, then we shall find a way to improve these peoples habits, not kill them because they aren't 'like us'.	Only .06% of people who have killed kill again when they escape, are released, etc.
1	17	7933	33	40	1	17	1	1	So as long as only some innocent people are killed for crimes they didn't commit then the system must be sound.	Only .06% of people who have killed kill again when they escape, are released, etc.
1	2659	5572	39	261	1	0	4	1	I have a entirely different view as to what the goal of capital punishment should be.	I used to be for the death penalty, however two things made me question my position.
3	30812	14510	16	55	3	14	1	3	If someone kills my child, my parent, my siblings, my love, i would want them to pay the price.	If you raped and killed my kids, I would not want you to be executed.
3	28050	32744	216	26	3	1	4	3	I feel as though you're implying that the death penalty is an effective crime deterrent.	It seems that you're assuming the correlation between crime rate and countries with capital punishment is that the death penalty encourages crime.
3.666666667	36893	28050	35	146	3	2	4	3	Life without parole costs the justice system WAAAY less than death penalty cases do.	Either way it will cost money, yet if the death penalty cut out some of it's steps it'd be less money than life imprisonment.
1.666666667	14127	5572	79	188	3	6	3	1	I suppose that, for most people, having to serve a life sentence without parole would already ruin their life enough that any who would be detered by fear of punishment are already detered.	i think that life without opportunity of parole is the more humane and just punishment instead of the death penalty.
3.333333333	33045	3271	63	118	3	3	4	1	Even though you deny it, your statements show you have no problem executing innocent people.	If you support the death penalty and concede that an innocent man could be put to death, you must be willing to put your name in the hat, with every one else, to have the government execute you by mistake.
3	1676	1676	44	49	1	2	2	1	IE - the death penalty acts as a deterrent to other would be murderers.	The death penalty should not be catagorized as a deterrent.
2.666666667	2652	18153	26	51	1	4	2	3	There shouldn't be a death penalty it isn't fair.	I support the death penalty, but feel there needs to be a better system of checks and balances to ensure each individual gets a fair trial using all evidentiary methods available.
1.666666667	4774	4774	4	15	1	0	0	1	You could just as easily argue that he was unjustly put to death and therefore it is a statement against the death penalty.	If you are going to argue for or against the death penalty, at least try to be a credit to the argument and present something that makes sense.
3	14127	14510	46	29	3	2	2	3	The government shouldnt make people spend the rest of their life in prison or jail because that would be a cruel and unusual punishment.	People who commit bad crimes shouldn't be allowed to suffer in prison for the rest of their life.
2.666666667	4690	4690	54	149	1	1	2	1	Bleeding hearts will not accept the fact that the death penalty is a deterrent and saves innocent lives.	You need to find lots more for the death penalty to save more lives than innocents that have been executed by it.
2.666666667	5572	5572	266	265	1	7	0	1	So how about we stop a penalty that has executed innocents?	Given the scrutiny of death penalty cases, it seems that we would be more likely to lock someone up for life in prison and never uncover their innocence than we are to execute an innocent person.
1	4690	14127	87	85	1	9	4	3	Yeah, including the human judgment that says that the death penalty is wrong.	Life is a precious thing (after all, you're proposing the death penalty because of killing) and even ONE incorrect execution is one too many.
1.333333333	25683	32744	90	25	3	33	1	3	You have just shown your position why we should use the death penalty, but i have not seen the solution for people who are making crime?	The death penalty again has not only shown but proved to deter murder so therefore i wpuld suggest you reconsider your closing arguments.
1.666666667	5572	7933	33	2	1	2	5	1	The biggest problem I have with the death penalty is the cost.	Long prison time only costs us money and is a huge waste... I suppose we can do a involuntary servitude thing for first time offenders or something if you have a real problem with killing them though...
1.333333333	823	5572	1	260	1	6	1	1	This is why I'm aganist the penalty as punishment.	Personally I am more interested in the deterrent effect of capital punishment over the punishment aspect.
3.333333333	31664	25683	49	26	3	21	0	3	IMO the death penalty is about justice for the loved ones of the victims.	Therefore, the Death Penalty stands as a humane form of justice.
1	7933	5572	292	186	1	9	15	1	In reality I wouldn't care if the death penalty were gone.	I don't care if it is in the name of justice or if someone just wants to avenge a death, murder is murder, no matter how it is done.
1.333333333	33045	4690	75	32	3	2	17	1	No letting the family or friends of the victim kill the convicted person might be childish revenge.	Once the danger is gone killing a person is simply murder.
2.666666667	4690	28050	115	203	1	0	0	3	"""We know for a FACT that innocent people have been put to death already""- then give me their names."	With all this talk about innocent people being put to death, I was wondering.
4.666666667	3065	1676	8	49	1	2	2	1	IE - the death penalty acts as a deterrent to other would be murderers.	The deterrent of the death penalty cannot be directed at the executed, but does put fear in the minds of other potential capital criminals.
1.666666667	4690	28050	88	195	1	3	5	3	"If anything, this kind of ""argument"" is an argument for abolishing the death penalty, since it isn't used uniformly across the entire country."	Only some states use the death penalty, only some countries allow the death penalty.
1.666666667	22346	15556	10	6	3	3	3	3	if someone commits any crime, then they are a criminal by definition and should die.	Well I think that if someone commits a crime worthy of the death penalty they should get a sentence for life that way they can't be a repeat offender.
1	31664	7933	24	25	3	1	6	1	I think I could kill someone trying to kill any one of my children.	I also don't think someone has been put to death for a third degree murder.
5	22346	18153	25	52	3	3	2	3	First it is more expensive to kill a person, then letting him stay for a life long imprisonment.	It costs far more to execute a person than to keep him or her in prison for life.
1	14127	18153	74	54	3	8	2	3	If you think there shouldn't be a death penalty, you're an idiot.	My final point is, whether you believe in the afterlife or whether you think once we're dead this is it, do you not think death is the least punishing form of punishment?
4	12024	14127	1	49	3	1	10	3	To summarize, I think the death penalty should be used, but only in extreme cases.	I don't think everyone should be put to death.
2.333333333	7933	13293	252	16	1	8	0	3	I don't believe that they should because if you kill someone, they won't have the chance to either get rehabilitated nor will they have the chance to actually regret what they have done.	You're assuming (a) convicted murderers regret killing their victims (b) that they think of their victims as innocent and (c) that I care what murderers feel or think.
3	31664	20886	23	4	3	10	1	3	The government does not have the right to kill people.	Death penalty is lawful (in some states) because a majority of the people has agreed to give the justice system the power to kill with our permission.
1	7933	28050	228	45	1	5	0	3	The death penalty is not used for what it is supposed to be used for.	Besides I'm not saying we should apply the death penalty in all instances of murder for example.
1.333333333	373	25683	36	87	1	8	24	3	The death penalty provides a possible (but by no means apparent) benefit on crime rates compared to imprisonment, but a very definite loss on human happiness.	And especially why would one do that if it means death penalty would become possible?
4.333333333	4690	1676	62	26	1	13	2	1	The death of a criminal prevents him from committing any further crimes.	Both the death penalty and a life sentence would have prevent further murders.
4.666666667	7933	17	292	134	1	9	2	1	killing a person, no matter the reason, is still murder.	I don't care if it is in the name of justice or if someone just wants to avenge a death, murder is murder, no matter how it is done.
4.333333333	14127	18153	80	39	3	0	4	3	Additionally, i hold the belif that if it is wrong for an individual to kill, then it is also wrong for the state, which is a representation of the individuals, to kill as well.	if a person kills another person it is murder, whether it is sanctioned by the state or not.
1	28050	4690	178	204	3	0	10	1	I don't believe the death penalty should be allowed for circumstantial evidenc.	The death penalty right now is to easy even I think.
3.666666667	5572	15556	136	14	1	2	3	3	The death penalty is about specific crimes, not any crimes.	I believe there are certain crimes where the death penalty is an acceptable punishment.
1	28050	2104	208	16	3	9	3	1	People who will commit a crime with life in prison would probably still commit the crime with capital punishment.	Nonsense, the issue of people being put to death for crimes that they likely NEVER committed is only one issue with the death penalty.
1	4690	33045	62	37	1	9	14	3	Why do people even question whether death is an acceptable form of punishment in the first place?	If it has nothing to do with the death penalty, how could it have anything to do with lives saved by the death penalty in the first place?
3.333333333	4690	15556	202	15	1	0	3	3	Some crimes are so heinous that the person who committed the crime deserves to die: I would only agree to this if the execution erased the crime that was committed in the first place.	"If I ever ""murder"" someone without cause, I would deserve to die."
2.333333333	2358	7933	17	250	1	4	0	1	No he the guy who killed twitter should have to suffer in jail and think about what he done for the rest of his life, and not be given the easy way out buy the death pentaly.	After we get through that, if he still retains the death penalty, it's a lot cheaper to kill him than to keep him up 'til he dies in prison.
1.333333333	20886	3065	1	23	3	1	2	1	I say if someone gets life w/o parole, they should be put into a real jail, rather than the country clubs many criminals go to.	If I were charged to do something that forced me to spend the rest of my life in jail, I would rather die right now - I think they're doing the criminal a favor by putting him down.
2.666666667	25683	823	62	8	3	2	4	1	Texas has the most executions and the most murders as well.	Texas, with many executions, followed the same trend as states without any executions.
1	31664	30812	16	18	3	4	2	3	There have been about 111 people sentenced to death who were found guilty while waiting.	Well, some other people feel insecure about life-sentences in prison!
1.666666667	373	12024	30	14	1	0	0	3	The problem with the death penalty is eventually someone will be sentenced to death when they are in fact guilty.	And had the death penalty been in effect, those kids might have died.
5	1676	5572	44	287	1	2	2	1	Many people argue that the death penalty is not a detterence.	The death penalty should not be catagorized as a deterrent.

1	25683	14127	85	30	3	9	6	3	Because there's nothing to say that life imprisonment is a less harsh punishment.	Almost every study I've seen on the deterrent effect of the death penalty has suggested that it's no more effective than life imprisonment.
2.333333333	17	17	43	7	1	0	8	1	it is quite clear that Jesus did not support the death penalty.	both me and thistown have quoted Jesus to support our stance on the death penalty.
3.333333333	28050	5572	34	164	3	1	0	1	But life imprisonment without parole also deters the criminal from recommitting.	Does the death penalty deter evil more than life in prison?
1	14127	14510	49	11	3	4	1	3	There has been so much cases of people who have been executed, only to be found innocent after their death.	Most people would agree that someone who kills someone in self defense doesn't deserve the death penalty, but there have been a couple of recent cases where someone killed someone in revenge for molesting their children.
1	5572	823	261	9	1	4	1	1	If that is the case I am against Capital Punishment.	I have a entirely different view as to what the goal of capital punishment should be.
1.666666667	3065	22346	76	19	1	2	0	3	its a eye for an eye, you might go to their level but you kill someone you should face the death penalty unless they kill in self defence.	But why do you have to get rid of them by killing them.
2	33045	28050	29	9	3	7	1	3	The cost of execution is dependant on the state the prisoner is to be tried and executed in.	And sure it is at a cost to the taxpayer, but whether or not we execute someone should not be dependent upon the relative financial cost.
4	1676	3065	16	94	1	6	0	1	Were I to argue in front of the Supreme Court (and I confess I have no idea what I'd wear) I would take the position that Life Imprisonment without the possibility of parole is Cruel and Unusual.	I think it could be proven that putting somebody in prison for life whent ehy have requested the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment.
2	7933	5572	12	186	1	9	15	1	In reality I wouldn't care if the death penalty were gone.	While I am not against execution, I would rather see tax dollars go to something a bit more useful than trying to execute one person.
3.333333333	4690	17	88	122	1	5	1	1	But are there any stats available showing countries/states with the death penalty have a higher/lower crime rate?	I'm pretty sure that the states with the death penalty do NOT have better crime rates or even better capital crime rates.
4.666666667	5572	5572	255	196	1	5	6	1	Most people who would be deterred already seem to be deterred by life without parole as a punishment.	But the statistics don't support the idea that the death penalty is any more effective as a detterent than is a life sentence.
4	7933	5572	126	225	1	3	1	1	Many people find some crimes heinous enough to warrent the death penalty.	The people who qualify for the death penalty are charged with committing some considerably heinous crime(s) that society has deemed unacceptable.
1.666666667	4756	5065	59	1	1	7	6	1	By not giving the death penalty to a slaughtering murderer, we are telling the world that the life of this murderer is worth more than that of his victim.	Life incarceration will never let him kill again, and its cheaper.
3.333333333	1128	25683	5	110	1	0	0	3	I see no point in letting someone live who does not want to live, or letting someone die who does not want to die.	"I am ""for"" capital punishment... but if a criminal shows a desire for death over a life sentence, I prefer to be sadistic."
1.333333333	30812	17	97	121	3	16	3	1	By the same token, if we keep administering the death penalty while the system is broken, we will have a much greater risk of putting someone innocent to death.	Exactly the sort of person that we might want put to death by the justice system.
1	373	5572	30	249	1	0	9	1	(Assault would not be one of them unless it caused death or was a sexual assault on a child.)	And had the death penalty been in effect, those kids might have died.
1.666666667	32744	14510	10	24	3	3	2	3	if someone killed you wouldn't you want them dead?	How can you justify teaching a generation of children that to stop killers from killing because killing is wrong, we should kill them?
3.666666667	1128	6937	23	85	1	1	2	1	If the system is good enough to send someone to prison for life, it should be good enough to send them to death row.	They shouldn't want to send an innocent person to prison for life either so it should have been pretty clear they were guilty already.
1	33045	33045	38	60	3	21	0	3	I think death penalties should be allowed for harsh offenses.	I don't even give a shit about the death penalty, I was just making a point.
3	30812	17	46	134	3	6	2	1	killing a person, no matter the reason, is still murder.	No one asks a murderer if killing a person for wearing pink feels like killing a person that has killed another... It may be equally as justified.
3	6937	31664	28	17	1	1	0	3	The reason to be for the death penalty is because it is just; the same foundation of support for all sanctions.	The reasons given most often for supporting the death penalty are emotional reasons of retribution for the heinous acts of the criminal.
2	30697	28050	23	1	3	5	1	3	I think it is philosophically and morally justified to execute anyone who has murdered another human being.	However, as I know many disagree, I think there should be understandings for justifiable murders.
1.666666667	31664	32744	46	41	3	0	6	3	I do not think that a government should be unable to kill someone, simply that they almost always should not.	One way that would make me happy with the death penalty is if the person was killed in the same way as the person that they murdered.
2.333333333	4690	25683	115	58	1	0	0	3	But I oppose the death penalty because it has the capacity to kill innocent people.	With all this talk about innocent people being put to death, I was wondering.
1	5572	25683	51	7	1	22	5	3	The court time is not inevitable, otherwise there wouldn't be an argument as to the death penalty being more expensive than life imprisonment.	There would be executions for murderers and jail time for others.
2	4690	4774	32	8	1	18	11	1	God gave to government the legitimate authority to use capital punishment to restrain murder and to punish murderers.	The death penalty is simply a legally imposed punishment given to felons who commited crimes for which the death penalty is applicable.
1.333333333	5572	14127	304	80	1	5	0	3	if a person kills another person it is murder, whether it is sanctioned by the state or not.	As far as someone killing while in prison, or escaping and killing innocents, I have addressed this too, and have stated that this is part of the reason I support the death penalty.
1.333333333	30812	13293	111	8	3	0	3	3	I'm not saying that a child's life is worth more than an adults, I'm saying if they killed any one they forfeit their life, because they in return lose what they took from someone else.	I think people suffer more when they spend their whole lives in jail.
2	5304	5572	5	164	1	9	0	1	But life imprisonment without parole also deters the criminal from recommitting.	The jury came back with a recommendation of life imprisonment.
3	28050	17	37	115	3	9	0	1	No death penalty = less prison space = more money spent on building new prisons = no money saved	Living in jail for life costs less money then the death penalty.
1.666666667	8212	14127	16	92	3	4	17	3	Still, in some cases death penalty would be the right thing to do (no point keeping mentally insane murderers just locked up for their whole life, although there could be some ways to use them).	The death penalty is gives the ability to off killers and murderers, as, if they were given life in parole, they have the ability to escape and continue their crimes.
2.333333333	31664	36893	54	1	3	1	0	3	Yes, death penalty is not a qualified punishment for a crime.	The truth is that the Death Penalty punishes those who have convicted a crime of extreme severity, not any criminal who commits a crime.
3.666666667	25683	33045	89	23	3	25	1	3	If the death penalty were an adequate deterrent then we would not have murder.	The death penalty has not been shown to be more effective than life imprisonment in deterring murder, hence we should choose life imprisonment.
1.333333333	6904	5572	7	142	1	10	5	1	I'm not suggesting that criminals cannot and do not change...of course they do.	And if you show me where the bible say's to let the murderer go free to kill again, or to treat them with respect and dignity, I'll quickly change my stance.
1.666666667	373	3065	5	30	1	26	2	1	A life sentence can be reversed if th convicted individual is later found innocent by new evidence.	The jury sees partially false evidence which has been biased by a lawyer and the emotions of the family members, and then convicts an innocent person and sentence him to death.
2.666666667	3065	28050	88	46	1	5	3	3	the death penalty also is premediated murder,it demeans the state and makes society more violent!	abortion does not qualify as state murder like the death penalty.
3.333333333	2659	4690	31	119	1	4	3	1	Hitler killed a whole race, you are basically saying you don't mind if we kill a bunch of innocent people as long as we get guilty people as well.	That doesn't ensure that we don't end up murdering innocent people.
2	5572	14127	248	60	1	7	30	3	You can attempt say I'm being illogical, but you have yet to explain why the death penalty is preferable to imprisonment.	If you accept vengeance as a reason for punishment then I understand why you would support the death penalty.
2	2104	25683	66	41	1	1	7	3	Which means that the execution rate may be low and still act as even more of a deterrent if publicity is increased.	If capital punishment works (deterrent), why do we have such a high murder rate per capita?
2	14127	22346	79	25	3	6	38	3	In every state that retains the death penalty, jurors have the option of sentencing convicted capital murderers to life in prison without the possibility of parole.	i think that life without opportunity of parole is the more humane and just punishment instead of the death penalty.
1	28050	30812	84	112	3	12	0	3	I dont think staying in prison for life is more punishment.	I dont think the death penalty should be apllied in just any case.
3.333333333	28050	25683	68	7	3	8	5	3	The court time is not inevitable, otherwise there wouldn't be an argument as to the death penalty being more expensive than life imprisonment.	Not to mention that the death penalty is more costly than simple life in prison in both money and time.

I am personally against the death penalty but would like to know in this particular scenario how just giving him life in prison would have been any different.
3	5572	28050	39	68	1	0	8	3	Not to mention that the death penalty is more costly than simple life in prison in both money and time.	Actually, the idea that the death penalty costs more than lifetime imprisonment has been disproved many times.
1.333333333	33642	30697	21	7	3	0	2	3	For that I do not disagree, yes hundreds maybe thousands of people have either been sentenced to death or served a period of time in jail for a crime they did not commit.	I am not disagreeing with punishing criminals for crimes they have committed.
1	4690	3065	78	23	1	3	5	1	Although there is much controversy about him, I agree that prisons, especially for those for whom the death penalty could be considered, should be punishment.	An argument regarding the death penalty should be confined to discussions regarding those who have been wrongly convicted and sentenced to death.
2	3065	1676	5	47	1	5	1	1	If a person is deterred from commiting a crime it is because fear in that person's mind has prevented him from commiting the crime.	Well one thing for sure the muderer or rapist who is executed will never commit those crimes again........He is permanently deterred........
0.333333333	7933	4774	297	58	1	20	5	1	its simply that the option exists to get around the death penalty.	Because death and war has been around longer than man has existed.
4.333333333	823	14510	49	59	1	0	0	3	They don't have to be sentenced to death until the evidence and conclusion is completely inescapable.	The point is, when a crime is committed that warrants the death penalty and there is irrefutable evidence to suggest that the personal being held responsible is guilty, than they should be sentenced to death.
3	1128	1128	3	42	1	1	1	1	"And no one said that life in prision is ""much worse"" then the death penalty."	Death is a much kinder sentence than life in prison, if you are sentenced to life, you should get to suffer for the whole bit.
2.333333333	3065	5572	108	192	1	116	1	1	Other countries not having it doesn't say anything about the morality of the death penalty.	The death penalty demeans the moral order and execution does something
1.333333333	22346	5572	21	4	3	0	0	1	I find it rather odd that many of the countries that ban the death penalty allow abortion as if killing a killer is worse than killing an innocent life.	I find it quite strange that no one bothered to ask why you why are against killing people...
1	5572	7933	219	207	1	9	17	1	Also, I wonder if a criminal thinks of the punishment when he commits the crime - if he were counting on being punished, he wouldn't have done it.	if you execute a pickpocket or give him life imprisonment, then you would have one less thief to worry about but I think we agree that that would be excessive).
3.666666667	13526	373	5	19	3	0	1	1	I think the death penalty should only be used when there is undeniable proof against the suspect.	If the justice system is organized and operated correctly, then I believe the death penalty should be used, but it should only be used in very severe cases.
1.333333333	5572	1676	201	10	1	3	5	1	Someone who commits a crime that serious should at least be behind bars for the rest of their life, no parole at all.	There is an even smaller chance of an innocent person being sent to prison for the rest of their life, let alone to be convicted of a crime and sent to death.
1	28050	33045	113	30	3	1	8	3	Only psychopaths will deterrence not work because most people value their life over others first so the deterrence of the death penalty is inherent.	The people dying from the death penalty are guilty people who have taken the lives of others.
4.333333333	4756	4756	7	7	1	22	9	1	The law recognizes the specific distinction between those legally innocent and those actually innocent, just as common sense dictates.	Furthermore, for many years, the United States' courts have repeatedly enforced the obvious, common sense, important distinction between the actually innocent and the legally innocent (5).
1.333333333	2652	25683	10	104	1	1	2	3	killing someone who has raped them or hurt a family member, while some of these reasons would definitely require being locked up the death penalty does not seem right for alot of situations	If a person wasn't convicted then they surely wouldn't be murdered by the state.
1.666666667	33642	7933	21	207	3	0	17	1	Also, I wonder if a criminal thinks of the punishment when he commits the crime - if he were counting on being punished, he wouldn't have done it.	I am not disagreeing with punishing criminals for crimes they have committed.
1	4690	17	149	136	1	7	1	1	So we kill killers, but in the end, end up with more murders.	We seem to have more compassion for the victims and potential victims of murderers than we do for the murderers.
1	17	30812	134	16	1	4	14	3	If you raped and killed my kids, I would not want you to be executed.	By killing a person who murdered someone, you are just doing the same thing you are punishing him/her for.
1	2652	4774	31	15	1	7	0	1	You could just as easily argue that he was unjustly put to death and therefore it is a statement against the death penalty.	And that killer has help, he has the people that support the death penalty and will give him more appeals, and if found guilty he'll get an easy way out with death, he won't have to suffer.
2.333333333	8212	5572	16	39	3	4	19	1	What if they don't kill anyone in their escape attempt?	The death penalty is gives the ability to off killers and murderers, as, if they were given life in parole, they have the ability to escape and continue their crimes.
3.333333333	13293	7933	12	250	3	2	0	1	No he the guy who killed twitter should have to suffer in jail and think about what he done for the rest of his life, and not be given the easy way out buy the death pentaly.	No one who committed such an act should get the easy way out with death.

3	5572	25683	222	90	1	10	33	3	The death penalty again has not only shown but proved to deter murder so therefore i wpuld suggest you reconsider your closing arguments.	Statistics show that capital punishment is no more of a deterrent than life without parole so I fail to see your arguement about society needing capital punishment.
1.333333333	2104	1128	9	40	1	9	0	1	I guess the question begs to be asked to my friends on the left is If life in prisonment is so much worse then the death penalty why do you think most prisoners on death row would choose that option?	I am not sure, which also begs the question on my support for the death penalty.
1.666666667	31664	33642	54	21	3	1	0	3	I am not disagreeing with punishing criminals for crimes they have committed.	The truth is that the Death Penalty punishes those who have convicted a crime of extreme severity, not any criminal who commits a crime.
2.666666667	25683	28050	42	34	3	15	1	3	Does the death penalty deter evil more than life in prison?	Even if the death penalty does not deter serial killers, it prevents them from killing again in society or in prison.
1	17	28050	33	208	1	16	9	3	Nonsense, the issue of people being put to death for crimes that they likely NEVER committed is only one issue with the death penalty.	An argument for putting people to death is so that they can never escape and kill again.
1	31664	4690	24	115	3	1	0	1	With all this talk about innocent people being put to death, I was wondering.	I also don't think someone has been put to death for a third degree murder.

4.666666667	25683	2652	58	25	3	4	2	1	My argument is that innocent people have been killed by the death penalty.	therefore the death penalty should not be used, simply because it kills innocent people.

4.666666667	28050	30697	105	17	3	1	0	3	Death penalty should be allowed as it deters people from committing serious crimes such as murder.	, I believe the death penalty has deterred at least some people from committing murder.
3	17	823	124	12	1	0	1	1	As of yet, we have not seen fact one that even one innocent person has been put to death.	I would support the death penalty IF there was a way to ensure that it would not put innocent people to death.

3	28050	25683	37	67	3	22	10	3	If the execution rate decreased and the murder rate increased then that explains the deterrence effect of capital punishment.	In addition, it is evident that the death penalty does not deter murder rates.

1	25683	28050	84	151	3	4	11	3	The studies are very clear that people are routinely convicted of crimes that they never committed, period.	Therefore, people will think twice before they choose to commit a crime and also, the death penalty has been proven to deter the crime rate.
3.333333333	33045	1128	90	31	3	0	1	1	Anyway, with that I would actually favor allowing criminals to choose death as long as they choose death with no appeals.	I think that if the murderer wants the death penalty, they should be allowed it if the victim's family agrees- but for crimes of passion and misunderstanding, no death penalty.
1	5572	28050	292	209	1	9	16	3	Arguments that support the death penalty are the only ones that can reference the Constitution.	Deterrence is not the only reason I support the death penalty.

1	5572	4756	256	68	1	13	18	1	They support it because killing murderers is the right thing to do.	If they know they'll die if caught, they'll likely kill more rape victims and children.
1	14127	30812	60	74	3	30	7	3	Like I said, I don't disagree with the theory of the death penalty.	You can attempt say I'm being illogical, but you have yet to explain why the death penalty is preferable to imprisonment.
2.333333333	3186	7933	42	56	1	6	1	1	Especially given that you have accepted that some innocent people are executed.	Or you could merely ignore them and concede that the death penalty is flawed, kills innocent people and costs the lives of innocents in the use of how it is funded
1	7933	32744	188	7	1	3	4	3	You are against of violence, but have you ever thought that death penalty is also violence?	It is people like you that let violent criminals walk free, because you evidently feel sorrow for them.
2.333333333	5572	6937	192	63	1	1	0	1	My conscience says that it the death penalty is immoral.	Other countries not having it doesn't say anything about the morality of the death penalty.
1.333333333	14127	1128	88	5	3	14	0	1	"I am ""for"" capital punishment... but if a criminal shows a desire for death over a life sentence, I prefer to be sadistic."	Again I want to reiterate that I am not in favor of an anarchist society where there is no consequences for committing crimes, my point is that society is better served by life imprisonment than the death penalty.
2.333333333	3065	13293	23	8	1	1	3	3	I'm not saying that a child's life is worth more than an adults, I'm saying if they killed any one they forfeit their life, because they in return lose what they took from someone else.	But I can't get past the fact that they'll be killed for killing someone else - it's hypocritical.
1	25683	17	85	72	3	9	2	1	I was saying, if the death penalty wasn't legit, and life imprisonment was actually the righteous thing to do, the concern of escapes shouldn't keep us from doing what's right.	Almost every study I've seen on the deterrent effect of the death penalty has suggested that it's no more effective than life imprisonment.
3.333333333	2104	25683	66	67	1	1	10	3	If the execution rate decreased and the murder rate increased then that explains the deterrence effect of capital punishment.	If capital punishment works (deterrent), why do we have such a high murder rate per capita?
1	3186	18153	80	52	1	7	2	3	First it is more expensive to kill a person, then letting him stay for a life long imprisonment.	But killing someone because of him killing someone is quite hypocritical.
1.333333333	28050	32206	68	20	3	7	3	3	You make it sound as though if someone is innocent, of anything, they should be killed.	And if it doesn't... the people who have killed the most under the death penalty will end up strapped to that bed too if they make it a capital offense to accidentally kill an innocent person.
1	28050	1676	203	59	3	18	6	1	The death penalty is not deterrance for the person executed.	The death penalty has been used as a scapegoat for many people who are against executions.
2.333333333	28237	31664	2	47	3	0	4	3	Imprisonment deters possible crimes; there is always the risk of escape or release.	The death penalty is the best possible deterrent for crime.
3.333333333	28050	17	115	135	3	0	1	1	If a person commits murder, I don't believe they deserve to live.	If someone is bad enough to be considered for the death penalty then they must have had sure evidence that they are guilty if they are then they shouldn't deserve the right to live among people they could kill
1	28050	373	35	11	3	0	1	1	Capital punishment is killing someone as a punishment for a crime they committed.	The death penalty is useless deterrent of crime because in the states that have them, they are not any more inclined to commit a crime because the threat of death penalty particularly if it is murder.
1	4690	33045	88	71	1	3	0	3	Yes, the death penalty should be use as a punishment.	Only some states use the death penalty, only some countries allow the death penalty.
2	4690	7933	76	244	1	3	5	1	And no, I don't the death penalty is murder.	...and if I do someday murder someone, I should be killed.
2	15556	373	6	11	3	3	1	1	Capital punishment is killing someone as a punishment for a crime they committed.	if someone commits any crime, then they are a criminal by definition and should die.
1.333333333	31664	4690	46	76	3	0	3	1	...and if I do someday murder someone, I should be killed.	One way that would make me happy with the death penalty is if the person was killed in the same way as the person that they murdered.
3	8212	8212	5	10	3	0	0	3	I don't see where in your first source it says that the majority of all countries (or the majority of people in every country) support the death penalty in some cases.	The majority populations of all countries may support the death penalty for some crimes (1).
3.666666667	28050	22346	196	25	3	0	10	3	Moreover, states without the death penalty have much lower murder rates.	Most other first-world countries don't have the death penalty, but have lower rates of crime, just pointing that out.
3	14127	14127	89	88	3	13	14	3	Again I want to reiterate that I am not in favor of an anarchist society where there is no consequences for committing crimes, my point is that society is better served by life imprisonment than the death penalty.	And no, society is not better served by life imprisonment than the death penalty because society then learns that consequences aren't very severe for committing an act of murder.
1.333333333	30697	13526	32	8	3	0	7	3	So all in all I believe in the death penalty.	I'd have to do more research into the death penalty website before believing the facts they present.
3.666666667	4690	25683	147	58	1	1	0	3	But I oppose the death penalty because it has the capacity to kill innocent people.	Exactly how many innocent people has the death penalty killed?
2.666666667	28050	28050	39	39	3	6	7	3	America, has no doubt evolved as a civilized society, but it has terrible enemies who would work from within its society and this may be a reason for wanting to continue death penalty.	"The question of whether death sentence should be allowed to continue or not, is therefore dependent upon the society and in general a society that has evolved as a ""civilized"" society would not need such punishments."
1	7933	32744	25	41	1	6	6	3	I do not think that a government should be unable to kill someone, simply that they almost always should not.	I think I could kill someone trying to kill any one of my children.
3.666666667	5065	2652	1	25	1	22	2	1	My argument is that innocent people have been killed by the death penalty.	There are also people who will tell you that the death penalty actually kills innocent people.
3.666666667	25683	17	58	124	3	4	0	1	I would support the death penalty IF there was a way to ensure that it would not put innocent people to death.	therefore the death penalty should not be used, simply because it kills innocent people.
1	25683	5065	28	1	3	1	22	1	There are also people who will tell you that the death penalty actually kills innocent people.	"Serial killers, ""How many people did you kill?"""
1.666666667	3065	5572	74	292	1	16	9	1	Deterrence is not the only reason I support the death penalty.	So, the only reason I can really see why people support the death penalty is to have simple vengeance against the perpretrator.
1	5572	17	265	131	1	0	3	1	If we execute death penalty, we will not be better than murderers.	So how about we stop a penalty that has executed innocents?
3	14127	12024	80	4	3	0	3	3	The government doesn't have the right to take away someone's life, even in the case of murder.	if a person kills another person it is murder, whether it is sanctioned by the state or not.
2.333333333	373	31664	5	52	1	2	6	3	As long as we sentence people to a life in prison we are also GUARANTEED to sentence an innocent person.	If we sentence someone to life in prison, we can always free them at a later time if they are found to be innocent.
1	28050	5572	178	24	3	0	1	1	This is why I said what I said in the first place about why I'm against the death penalty.	The death penalty right now is to easy even I think.
2.333333333	30697	7933	17	310	3	0	0	1	The death penalty doesn't need to serve as a deterrent to crime.	Death penalty should be allowed as it deters people from committing serious crimes such as murder.
3.333333333	33045	2104	23	33	3	1	1	1	politicaly correct death penalty we impose here in America may not deter crime as well as we think it should.	If the death penalty were an adequate deterrent then we would not have murder.
1	33045	5572	38	260	3	21	1	1	This is why I'm aganist the penalty as punishment.	I don't even give a shit about the death penalty, I was just making a point.
2	28050	5572	64	265	3	0	0	1	So how about we stop a penalty that has executed innocents?	If we continue to allow the death penalty, we are no better than the murderers and rapists that we punish with the death penalty.
1.333333333	7933	7933	62	57	1	7	2	1	One of the many grievances I have is that child rapists don't qualify for the death penalty unless the child that gets raped is also killed.	I have been a victim of rape and if I were a victim of murder I would not desire the death penalty for the perpetrator.
1	4756	17	96	134	1	1	2	1	killing a person, no matter the reason, is still murder.	There are no children being killed, and killing a child is murder in America.
1.666666667	28050	1128	68	42	3	8	1	1	"And no one said that life in prision is ""much worse"" then the death penalty."	Not to mention that the death penalty is more costly than simple life in prison in both money and time.
5	25683	25683	89	85	3	25	9	3	Almost every study I've seen on the deterrent effect of the death penalty has suggested that it's no more effective than life imprisonment.	The death penalty has not been shown to be more effective than life imprisonment in deterring murder, hence we should choose life imprisonment.
2.333333333	5572	14510	97	52	1	2	6	3	"For those who say ""we need to make sure they don't kill again"" no one in the history of maximum security prisons has ever escaped a maximum security prison, so it's not really an issue."	We let killers out of prison so they can kill again.
1	28050	18153	99	54	3	2	2	3	If you think there shouldn't be a death penalty, you're an idiot.	You are probably going to murder somebody; hopefully it will b in a place with the death penalty and then you will get what you deserve.
2	5572	32206	270	20	1	9	3	3	You make it sound as though if someone is innocent, of anything, they should be killed.	After all, the person you're torturing may actually be innocent.
1.666666667	7933	4690	292	202	1	9	0	1	"If I ever ""murder"" someone without cause, I would deserve to die."	I don't care if it is in the name of justice or if someone just wants to avenge a death, murder is murder, no matter how it is done.
1.333333333	14127	18153	33	54	3	16	2	3	If you think there shouldn't be a death penalty, you're an idiot.	And hey, if you think man is just an animal, then the death penalty shouldn't matter to you since you can't say life has any intrinsic value (remember, you believe in relativity).
2.333333333	30812	3065	16	67	3	14	0	1	How do you compare killing a little child who has never had the chance to live to the execution of a criminal who has been raping and killing little children?	If you raped and killed my kids, I would not want you to be executed.
2	33642	25683	37	58	3	4	0	3	But I oppose the death penalty because it has the capacity to kill innocent people.	If these are indeed comparable, I wouldn't argue for the death penalty even in murder.
3	25683	2659	67	24	3	10	3	1	The death penalty as a deterrent, our murder rate loudly speaks to that.	If the execution rate decreased and the murder rate increased then that explains the deterrence effect of capital punishment.
2	7933	1676	25	78	1	6	12	1	If someone killed my relative, I wouldn't want them killed, I would want them to spend the rest of their lives in hard, back breaking labor.	I think I could kill someone trying to kill any one of my children.
1	4690	36893	18	31	1	5	5	3	All of this information is the reason the Death penalty is so costly.	It is called the death penalty for a reason...it is a penalty, a punishment.
4	28050	31664	37	18	3	22	3	3	BUT it is not apparent that death penalty lower crime rate.	In addition, it is evident that the death penalty does not deter murder rates.
2	28050	15556	20	18	3	0	3	3	That should be a crime which should result in the death penalty.	I assume in what follows that we, the country or the state, execute only for the crime of murder, though many capital punishment adherents would use it for other crimes, such as child rape, treason, arson, robbery and even fraud.
3	20886	7933	3	310	3	4	0	1	The death penalty doesn't need to serve as a deterrent to crime.	The death penalty has been found to be a more effective deterrent to crimes against children.
1.333333333	14510	28050	54	64	3	49	0	3	If we continue to allow the death penalty, we are no better than the murderers and rapists that we punish with the death penalty.	If we can not prevent the innocent from unjust punishment, we should not have the death penalty.
1.333333333	5572	373	304	28	1	5	3	1	Oh, and by the way, the criteria that I mentioned earlier was enough to kill someone for treason, so why shouldn't it be enough to kill someone for another crime?	As far as someone killing while in prison, or escaping and killing innocents, I have addressed this too, and have stated that this is part of the reason I support the death penalty.
2.333333333	2104	7933	64	65	1	1	8	1	I am willing to accept that some innocent people will fall victim, even potentially a family member.	I'm not really in favor of killing innocent people either.
3	33045	1676	72	49	3	1	2	1	IE - the death penalty acts as a deterrent to other would be murderers.	There is no crime which justifies others to kill as a form of punishment, and it is ineffective as a deterrent to prevent crime.
1.666666667	20886	28050	4	77	3	1	4	3	The government makes errors in releasing people who are still dangerous and in capturing people who are actually innocent.	The government does not have the right to kill people.
1	30697	28050	19	34	3	2	1	3	Does the death penalty deter evil more than life in prison?	The fact remains that life in prison is cheaper than sentencing one to the death penalty.
2	823	5572	13	266	1	0	9	1	However, I do not see any moral difference in locking up an innocent person for 60 year or executing an innocent person.	I have heard of two instances of innocent men who were executed back in the seventies.
2.666666667	3065	3186	52	5	1	0	0	1	"I certainly wouldn't count you as a friend, but I consider myself ""liberal"" in the way Americans use the term and yes I would oppose the death penalty in this case."	I am very conservative and I am opposed to abortion and the death penalty.
1	7933	7933	300	263	1	8	2	1	You think about the unfortunate soul who is truly innocent of murder and executed anyway.	Even if you think about it a second before you do it, you thought about it, and, then, it classifies it as murder.
2	14127	6937	53	32	3	3	2	1	Obviously, if someone were found innocent before execution, they would not be executed.	People have been found out to be innocent after the death penalty ha already been carried out....
1.333333333	4756	1128	11	5	1	4	0	1	"I am ""for"" capital punishment... but if a criminal shows a desire for death over a life sentence, I prefer to be sadistic."	Again, I support the death penalty for certain crimes and criminals.
1	4690	2358	115	5	1	0	1	1	But on another note, I wonder whether he wouldn't rather be sentenced to death than put with the general prison population.	With all this talk about innocent people being put to death, I was wondering.
1.333333333	32744	5572	7	221	3	4	3	1	You can't get much worse than a death penalty.	You are against of violence, but have you ever thought that death penalty is also violence?
1	28050	33045	114	90	3	1	0	3	I think that if the murderer wants the death penalty, they should be allowed it if the victim's family agrees- but for crimes of passion and misunderstanding, no death penalty.	I agree that the people who are killed are mostly innocent people and that those killed by the death penalty are almost certainly guilty of the crime.
2.666666667	823	25683	1	85	1	6	9	3	Almost every study I've seen on the deterrent effect of the death penalty has suggested that it's no more effective than life imprisonment.	Personally I am more interested in the deterrent effect of capital punishment over the punishment aspect.
1.333333333	5065	28050	1	84	1	5	4	3	In all honesty im glad i am not someone who has to decide murder as punishment for someone who has committed crimes.	When a person commits a crime, the Judicial system is responsible for determining a proportional response or penalty for the crime.
1.333333333	17	14127	26	60	1	0	30	3	You can attempt say I'm being illogical, but you have yet to explain why the death penalty is preferable to imprisonment.	Oh I'm not saying that the govenrment should do away with the death penalty on these grounds, I'm saying that Christian people should oppose it, you said it yourself.
1.333333333	4690	3271	90	52	1	0	8	1	I am responding.....you seem to think thatg life in prison is worse then the death penalty........I am telling you that the prisoners on death row would disagree........	As far as I know, you may as well ACTUALLY believe any number of things, if you actually believe in the death penalty.
1	17	20886	33	4	1	17	1	3	The government does not have the right to kill people.	Only .06% of people who have killed kill again when they escape, are released, etc.
1	14510	31664	64	30	3	1	1	3	I say that they should be killed the same way that the person(s) that they killed were.	When they are about to be shot just think what would be happening, some unlucky person would be dealing with the fact that they were going to have to take someone's life.
3.333333333	7933	4690	11	12	1	21	0	1	SO in turn, there is no clear evidence indicating that there is not a detterent value to the death penalty.	Unless there can be solid uncontestable evidence shown that the death penalty is significant in deterring crime, this cannot be used as an argument for the death penalty.
5	22346	30697	25	27	3	3	1	3	First, it is more expensive than sentencing someone to life in prison.	It costs far more to execute a person than to keep him or her in prison for life.
1.333333333	28050	1128	34	42	3	1	1	1	"And no one said that life in prision is ""much worse"" then the death penalty."	Does the death penalty deter evil more than life in prison?
3	6937	8212	24	10	1	1	0	3	I don't see where in your first source it says that the majority of all countries (or the majority of people in every country) support the death penalty in some cases.	It seems that there is still a majority in this country who is for the death penalty.
2	30812	2652	83	10	3	2	1	1	If a person wasn't convicted then they surely wouldn't be murdered by the state.	>>>If we are sure they raped & killed those innocent children then we should let them die.
1.333333333	30697	30812	23	74	3	5	7	3	Like I said, I don't disagree with the theory of the death penalty.	However, as I know many disagree, I think there should be understandings for justifiable murders.
2.666666667	3065	373	13	44	1	0	18	1	When we can perfect the American Justice System more, then I would lend more support to the death penalty.	Like I said no criminal justice system is perfect......
1	4690	31664	149	53	1	7	12	3	Odds are we are locking up more criminals than innocent victims.	We seem to have more compassion for the victims and potential victims of murderers than we do for the murderers.
4.666666667	17	33045	134	75	1	2	2	3	Once the danger is gone killing a person is simply murder.	killing a person, no matter the reason, is still murder.
1.333333333	14510	13293	64	16	3	1	0	3	I don't believe that they should because if you kill someone, they won't have the chance to either get rehabilitated nor will they have the chance to actually regret what they have done.	When they are about to be shot just think what would be happening, some unlucky person would be dealing with the fact that they were going to have to take someone's life.
2.666666667	4690	5572	32	263	1	18	5	1	The person having been convicted of a crime punishable by death and subsequently sentenced to death should be put to death.	The death penalty is simply a legally imposed punishment given to felons who commited crimes for which the death penalty is applicable.
3	25683	14127	67	35	3	10	7	3	Well according to your own paper, it says that you can't prove that the death penalty increases the murder rate.	If the execution rate decreased and the murder rate increased then that explains the deterrence effect of capital punishment.
3	2104	7933	64	314	1	1	2	1	Some innocent people are still sentenced to death, and that's where I see a problem.	I'm not really in favor of killing innocent people either.
3	28050	28050	139	115	3	0	0	3	If someone is bad enough to be considered for the death penalty then they must have had sure evidence that they are guilty if they are then they shouldn't deserve the right to live among people they could kill	just because someone is believed to have done something wrong doesnt mean that they are bad people who deserve to die...what if that happened to you?
2	14127	5572	92	302	3	8	0	1	So, in summary, you aren't against the death penalty on principle.	If law is flawed you don't ban death penalty, you fix the law.
3	7933	30812	31	16	1	9	14	3	If you raped and killed my kids, I would not want you to be executed.	If you rape a kid then you shouldn't be allowed to live.
1	32744	5572	10	97	3	3	2	1	We let killers out of prison so they can kill again.	How can you justify teaching a generation of children that to stop killers from killing because killing is wrong, we should kill them?
2.666666667	3186	33045	80	75	1	7	2	3	Once the danger is gone killing a person is simply murder.	But killing someone because of him killing someone is quite hypocritical.
1	5572	4690	200	18	1	11	5	1	It is called the death penalty for a reason...it is a penalty, a punishment.	The question with the death penalty is not kill or give no punishment.
2.333333333	4756	7933	35	2	1	7	12	1	In any case, while I believe some criminals should just be carried into the street and shot, I don't think the death penalty is worth it in today's society.	I firmly believe that some crimes and criminals are deserving of death.
2.333333333	4756	18153	5	7	1	3	0	3	while it is a fact that innocent people have been placed and convicted to death row condemned to die, there are however people who are guilty and should die.	My argument makes it clear that innocent people need not be sentenced to death in order for the death penalty to be unjust.
1.333333333	31664	17	27	135	3	6	1	1	If a person commits murder, I don't believe they deserve to live.	It wouldn't shock me if someone committed murder JUST to get those things.
4	13526	13175	5	22	3	0	0	3	I think the death penalty should only be used in extreme cases where the accused is, without a doubt, guilty.	If the justice system is organized and operated correctly, then I believe the death penalty should be used, but it should only be used in very severe cases.
1.666666667	5572	7933	251	62	1	0	7	1	I have been a victim of rape and if I were a victim of murder I would not desire the death penalty for the perpetrator.	Since I am not related to any death-row-inmate's victims (of murder, rape, molestation), I do not classify my desire to see them dead as vengeance.
3.666666667	4690	28050	88	202	1	5	25	3	States without the death penalty have fared BETTER in reducing their murder rates than states with the death penalty.	I'm pretty sure that the states with the death penalty do NOT have better crime rates or even better capital crime rates.
1.666666667	4690	7933	76	11	1	3	0	1	Though I would not call the death penalty murder, I am personally against it.	...and if I do someday murder someone, I should be killed.
1.333333333	7933	25683	292	110	1	9	0	3	I see no point in letting someone live who does not want to live, or letting someone die who does not want to die.	I don't care if it is in the name of justice or if someone just wants to avenge a death, murder is murder, no matter how it is done.
1	17	1128	131	60	1	3	11	1	If Europeans don't like the fact that we execute mass murderers in the US, then they'd better not come to the US to become a mass murderer.	If we execute death penalty, we will not be better than murderers.
1.333333333	17	823	131	36	1	3	34	1	We should not even have the death penalty just on the off chance that we might execute somebody who is innocent.	If we execute death penalty, we will not be better than murderers.
3.333333333	5572	32744	263	3	1	5	0	3	No, if it is already known that this person made the crime, the death penalty may be used.	The person having been convicted of a crime punishable by death and subsequently sentenced to death should be put to death.
3	25683	5572	86	164	3	31	0	1	But life imprisonment without parole also deters the criminal from recommitting.	Can life imprisonment for a definite yes, prevent a murderer from killing again?
1	4690	30812	88	87	1	3	5	3	Too much racism in this country to have the death penalty.	Only some states use the death penalty, only some countries allow the death penalty.
1.666666667	20886	5572	23	24	3	0	1	1	This is why I said what I said in the first place about why I'm against the death penalty.	I don't think the death penalty should be banned.
2	17	25683	134	7	1	2	27	3	There is no reason to give that person a death penalty.	killing a person, no matter the reason, is still murder.
1	31664	30697	52	27	3	6	1	3	First, it is more expensive than sentencing someone to life in prison.	As long as we sentence people to a life in prison we are also GUARANTEED to sentence an innocent person.
1.333333333	33045	4690	60	204	3	0	10	1	I don't believe the death penalty should be allowed for circumstantial evidenc.	I think death penalties should be allowed for harsh offenses.
2	31664	30697	25	23	3	0	5	3	However, as I know many disagree, I think there should be understandings for justifiable murders.	I believe that murder is the killing of a human being.
3.333333333	4756	14127	62	46	1	59	2	3	People who commit bad crimes shouldn't be allowed to suffer in prison for the rest of their life.	Some crimes are so terrible, life in prison just isn't enough.
2	373	4690	5	90	1	28	0	1	As far as I know, you may as well ACTUALLY believe any number of things, if you actually believe in the death penalty.	Sorry for the length of the post, but I hope it helps you understand why I oppose capital punishment.
4	5572	5572	164	255	1	0	7	1	It seems that those that would be deterred by fear of punishment are already dettered by the threat of a life sentence.	But life imprisonment without parole also deters the criminal from recommitting.
2	14127	28050	79	64	3	4	3	3	The death sentence has been used since the beginning of the United States, and rarely, if ever, has there been an occurrence in which someone avenges the death of a murderer or rapist.	the use of the death penalty is an act of revenge which cannot be undone, so should the state be put on trial for putting to death an innocent person?
1	28050	33045	64	23	3	0	1	3	If the death penalty were an adequate deterrent then we would not have murder.	If we continue to allow the death penalty, we are no better than the murderers and rapists that we punish with the death penalty.
3	17	17	108	64	1	0	2	1	If someone keeps killing and killing and killing, we need to stop him from taking lives.	That right to life was taken away, I agree, but we will not accomplish anything if we kill someone else.
1.333333333	13526	7933	22	224	3	0	2	1	No one said we are perfect, but neither should be lenient towards people who commit horrible crimes.	You say that all people who commit gruesome murders are psychopaths.
1.333333333	1676	30812	45	74	1	0	7	3	Like I said, I don't disagree with the theory of the death penalty.	"OK Jim, how can you disagree with my use of the word deterrent and turn around and say ""I think the death penalty is a detergent."
1.333333333	31664	15556	49	18	3	3	3	3	That should be a crime which should result in the death penalty.	The death penalty is an act of justice, yes justice, which while unable to supplement for the losses of others, can secure the isolation of a convicted criminal and also deliver a punishment for the crime.
3	5572	3186	145	95	1	9	26	1	I am pro-death penalty even though I conceed that every study I have seen suggests it does absolutely nothing to deter capitol crimes.	As far as the deterrent argument, I have said this before, and I will say it again: There is no accurate way to measure if the death penalty is deterring crime or not.
1.666666667	5572	31664	51	39	1	22	1	3	What if there were people killing other people, escaping from jail, doing it again etc.	There would be executions for murderers and jail time for others.
1.333333333	2104	5572	64	4	1	1	0	1	I find it rather odd that many of the countries that ban the death penalty allow abortion as if killing a killer is worse than killing an innocent life.	I'm not really in favor of killing innocent people either.
3	30697	36893	31	31	3	0	5	3	All of this information is the reason the Death penalty is so costly.	The only reason the death penalty is more expensive is because all the liberals want it banned so they make it as expensive as possible.
5	17	18153	137	52	1	23	2	3	First it is more expensive to kill a person, then letting him stay for a life long imprisonment.	Many people contend - and prove - that it's more costly to execute a man or to keep a man on deathrow than it would be to keep him in prison for life.
1.333333333	5572	4690	268	59	1	35	12	1	I will agree that the death penalty is too arbitrarily applied.	Agreed, I just don't share their beliefs as to why the penalty should be stopped.
0.666666667	8212	1128	16	34	3	4	1	1	If a criminal asks for the death penalty, give them a psychiatric evaluation to determine their mental state.	The death penalty is gives the ability to off killers and murderers, as, if they were given life in parole, they have the ability to escape and continue their crimes.
3.333333333	7933	4690	228	59	1	5	12	1	I will agree that the death penalty is too arbitrarily applied.	Besides I'm not saying we should apply the death penalty in all instances of murder for example.
2	30812	25683	16	7	3	14	22	3	I highly doubt the backing of why you personally would want the death penalty invoked is because you're worried at home that a mass murderer is going to escape and kill you or someone you love... seriously?	If you raped and killed my kids, I would not want you to be executed.
1	4690	14127	127	60	1	5	22	3	You can't just assume the death penalty is a crime.	There's no evidence that it actually prevents any crime (I assume you can, after all, get out of it if you admit guilt immediately and do a lot of butt-kissing, so fear of death wouldn�۪t be a factor?)
1	17	32206	134	20	1	4	3	3	You make it sound as though if someone is innocent, of anything, they should be killed.	By killing a person who murdered someone, you are just doing the same thing you are punishing him/her for.
3.666666667	1676	32744	72	26	1	4	4	3	I feel as though you're implying that the death penalty is an effective crime deterrent.	So, seems to me that when you make death a quick (as in timely) and certain punishment, there is most definitely a deterent effect.
2	4774	15556	13	18	1	1	3	3	That should be a crime which should result in the death penalty.	The death penalty executes felons found guilty of especially heinous crimes.
1.333333333	20886	2104	23	7	3	3	4	1	I am advocating life in prison without the option of parole.	Hellno is right, capital punishment should be much more cost effective than the alternative- life in prison without parole.
1	5572	4756	95	68	1	2	18	1	They support it because killing murderers is the right thing to do.	OF THE VICTIM would be able to visit or at least know they're family members are alive if the criminal hadn't KILLED THEM!!
2.333333333	28050	7933	84	244	3	12	6	1	Depending on that state's laws, if you're going to apply the death penalty, I find the death penalty appropriately applied to this case.	I dont think the death penalty should be apllied in just any case.
1.666666667	5572	15556	263	6	1	5	3	3	if someone commits any crime, then they are a criminal by definition and should die.	The person having been convicted of a crime punishable by death and subsequently sentenced to death should be put to death.
3.666666667	823	17	36	121	1	34	3	1	By the same token, if we keep administering the death penalty while the system is broken, we will have a much greater risk of putting someone innocent to death.	We should not even have the death penalty just on the off chance that we might execute somebody who is innocent.
1.666666667	25683	5572	58	304	3	0	5	1	As far as someone killing while in prison, or escaping and killing innocents, I have addressed this too, and have stated that this is part of the reason I support the death penalty.	But I oppose the death penalty because it has the capacity to kill innocent people.
2	18153	2652	11	25	3	0	2	1	My argument is that innocent people have been killed by the death penalty.	I think there should be a death penalty because, all those innocent people getting killed for no damn reason is unfair.
2.666666667	17	18153	128	7	1	1	0	3	while it is a fact that innocent people have been placed and convicted to death row condemned to die, there are however people who are guilty and should die.	If we don't stop the death penalty now, we will put innocent people to death while we try to fix the problems.
1.333333333	5572	4774	184	53	1	3	9	1	As it is today, when someone murderers another, the death penalty is considered, as it should be.	People generally think that the death penalty is worse than life without parole (certainly most criminals seem to think so).
3.333333333	28050	18153	16	52	3	7	0	3	There should no be a death penalty, since by taking a human's life, we are not saving it.	We make ourselves less by doing the same as the murder convict - that is, not valuing a human life.
2.666666667	25683	28050	90	203	3	1	19	3	Louisiana, a state with the death penalty and the highest murder rate in the country, has almost no gun control.	The murder rate for the state of New York, a state without the death penalty has increased this year with a higher rate of murder than it was in 2009.
1	18153	17	52	64	3	2	2	1	If someone keeps killing and killing and killing, we need to stop him from taking lives.	First it is more expensive to kill a person, then letting him stay for a life long imprisonment.
5	31664	28050	18	204	3	3	35	3	There's absolutely ZERO evidence that having a death penalty statute causes a lower crime rate, period.	BUT it is not apparent that death penalty lower crime rate.
4	28050	14127	37	88	3	22	10	3	studies show that the death penalty is not a deterrent (which is one half of the reason for it's use) and murder rates are actually higher in states that have the death penalty (http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/deterrence-states-without-death-penalty-                                       have-had-consistently-lower-murder-rates#stateswithvwithout).	In addition, it is evident that the death penalty does not deter murder rates.
2	14127	373	88	44	3	5	14	1	I would define mass murder as either a) The person killed multiple people who had no non-geographical connection or b) The person killed people at multiple times.	this is due to not only to multiple people killed by one person, but also the numerous unsolved cases each year.
1.666666667	14127	18153	79	7	3	4	0	3	while it is a fact that innocent people have been placed and convicted to death row condemned to die, there are however people who are guilty and should die.	the use of the death penalty is an act of revenge which cannot be undone, so should the state be put on trial for putting to death an innocent person?
1	5304	28050	6	7	1	1	1	3	Everything that is needed for an ordinary trial is the same for a Death Penalty case, only more so.	In all cases, the first punishment shouldn't be the death penalty.
1.666666667	4690	18153	18	7	1	2	0	3	while it is a fact that innocent people have been placed and convicted to death row condemned to die, there are however people who are guilty and should die.	The notion that innocent people may be sentenced to death is not a death penalty problem, it is a judicial system problem.

1.666666667	4756	6937	62	32	1	15	2	1	Obviously, if someone were found innocent before execution, they would not be executed.	If somebody is completely innocent and they are executed for a crime they didn't commit (which, with forensics these days, probably will never happen again), that is a problem.
1.666666667	28050	6937	141	32	3	2	2	1	Obviously, if someone were found innocent before execution, they would not be executed.	Also, Texas has executed persons who were, in fact, innocent.
1.333333333	33642	5572	1	39	3	1	14	1	Only if they try to murder somebody after they are in prison do they deserve the death penalty?	You might say the criminal deserved it, but murder is murder, whether they deserved it or not.
4	33045	1676	30	49	3	8	2	1	IE - the death penalty acts as a deterrent to other would be murderers.	Only psychopaths will deterrence not work because most people value their life over others first so the deterrence of the death penalty is inherent.
3.333333333	14127	28050	80	23	3	0	2	3	Granted, someone, who bestows great harm onto a family for egregious acts, doesn't give the government the right to kill that person.	if a person kills another person it is murder, whether it is sanctioned by the state or not.
3.666666667	14510	28050	11	203	3	1	0	3	"""We know for a FACT that innocent people have been put to death already""- then give me their names."	There has been so much cases of people who have been executed, only to be found innocent after their death.
1	4690	4756	147	62	1	1	49	1	Essentially, you believe a fetus should be allowed to be killed simply for existing, while you protect the lives of people who have murdered other innocent people (as murder is generally what a person will get the death penalty for).	Exactly how many innocent people has the death penalty killed?
2.333333333	28050	20886	37	23	3	9	3	3	Hellno is right, capital punishment should be much more cost effective than the alternative- life in prison without parole.	Living in jail for life costs less money then the death penalty.
4.666666667	31664	15556	54	14	3	1	3	3	The death penalty is about specific crimes, not any crimes.	The truth is that the Death Penalty punishes those who have convicted a crime of extreme severity, not any criminal who commits a crime.
1	5572	8212	24	10	1	1	0	3	I don't see where in your first source it says that the majority of all countries (or the majority of people in every country) support the death penalty in some cases.	This is why I said what I said in the first place about why I'm against the death penalty.
1	8200	2104	20	16	3	2	3	1	People who will commit a crime with life in prison would probably still commit the crime with capital punishment.	Second reason is that prisoners, who committed very cruel crimes and have a life term punishment, shouldn't be provided by government.
1.333333333	7933	4690	25	202	1	6	0	1	"If I ever ""murder"" someone without cause, I would deserve to die."	I think I could kill someone trying to kill any one of my children.
1	30812	31664	22	52	3	3	6	3	As long as we sentence people to a life in prison we are also GUARANTEED to sentence an innocent person.	The way I see it people who murder shouldn't be sentenced to death or spend life in the jails we have here there to nice.
2	7933	2652	320	12	1	0	5	1	Like I said, if the person isn't convicted, then they will not be murdered in the electric chair, or by lethal injection.	If we kill a few innocent lifes in the process, thats fine by me as long as the rightfuly convicted felons are killed VIA leathal injection and/or electric chair.
2.666666667	7933	5572	314	181	1	2	1	1	How many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent?	Some innocent people are still sentenced to death, and that's where I see a problem.
1	7933	18153	300	54	1	8	2	3	If you think there shouldn't be a death penalty, you're an idiot.	Even if you think about it a second before you do it, you thought about it, and, then, it classifies it as murder.
4	28050	28237	215	10	3	2	9	3	Since murder is viewed as wrong, it generally makes more sense to eliminate the death penalty because murder rates are generally lower in those states.	Also, within the USA, murder rates are consistently lower in states that don't have capital punishment.
1.666666667	4756	2104	62	16	1	59	3	1	People who will commit a crime with life in prison would probably still commit the crime with capital punishment.	Some crimes are so terrible, life in prison just isn't enough.
3	373	12024	19	1	1	1	1	3	I don't think everyone should be put to death.	I think the death penalty should only be used when there is undeniable proof against the suspect.
2.666666667	5572	4690	255	18	1	4	2	1	The notion that innocent people may be sentenced to death is not a death penalty problem, it is a judicial system problem.	Since there are many people sentenced for murder that are actually innocent (~10% who were sentenced to death who were proved innocent in appeal), you would be causing a lot more innocent deaths than you would be saving.
1.666666667	4756	823	7	8	1	262	4	1	Texas has the most executions and the most murders as well.	The Texas case of Lionel Herrera, like others, nationally, has been labeled, by many death penalty opponents, as an innocent executed.
1.666666667	25683	17	14	132	3	2	2	1	I am tired of seeing people on death row for 20 or 30 years before they are put to death.	Did you study when these people were exonerated and in what year were they placed on the death penalty?
1.333333333	5572	14127	38	60	1	4	30	3	You can attempt say I'm being illogical, but you have yet to explain why the death penalty is preferable to imprisonment.	You should also note that the one scenario I think the death penalty is acceptable for is if they try to escape using violence or if they attack another prisoner.
4.666666667	2104	2659	66	24	1	1	3	1	The death penalty as a deterrent, our murder rate loudly speaks to that.	If capital punishment works (deterrent), why do we have such a high murder rate per capita?
1	22346	4690	25	99	3	38	0	1	Acutally, long ago, the executioner was a convict also sentenced to death.	In every state that retains the death penalty, jurors have the option of sentencing convicted capital murderers to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
1	5572	3065	142	23	1	5	2	1	I say if someone gets life w/o parole, they should be put into a real jail, rather than the country clubs many criminals go to.	I'm not suggesting that criminals cannot and do not change...of course they do.
1.333333333	33642	30812	37	16	3	2	14	3	If you raped and killed my kids, I would not want you to be executed.	The point is that people who care about you will suffer more if you die than if you are tortured or raped.
2.666666667	5572	3271	270	42	1	9	7	1	Do you want a innocent person to pay with their life for your vengence which doesn't erase the crime?	After all, the person you're torturing may actually be innocent.
4	25683	4756	50	7	3	1	63	1	The evidence is overwhelming that some death penalty opponents were stating that the 102, nationwide, were actually innocent people, who had no connection to the murders.	I have evidence that says that innocent people are convicted of crimes.
1.333333333	3065	15556	68	15	1	7	3	3	Some crimes are so heinous that the person who committed the crime deserves to die: I would only agree to this if the execution erased the crime that was committed in the first place.	Second, he killed someone during the commission of another crime.
4.333333333	5572	5572	188	164	1	3	0	1	But life imprisonment without parole also deters the criminal from recommitting.	I suppose that, for most people, having to serve a life sentence without parole would already ruin their life enough that any who would be detered by fear of punishment are already detered.
2.666666667	5572	5572	292	287	1	9	2	1	Many people argue that the death penalty is not a detterence.	Deterrence is not the only reason I support the death penalty.
2.666666667	18153	13175	42	9	3	0	0	3	Death penalty should be abolished because i think this method is irreversible.	The abolishment of the death penalty is considered an advancement in most societies.
1.666666667	25683	18153	91	16	3	23	1	3	I dont believe that someone who killed or raped a lot of people should be able to live even if they are in a jail surrounded by other criminals.	Quite a lot of people think that criminals should be punished for the sake of punishing them, whether or not it deters anyone; I had thought you were one of them.
2	3065	5572	52	85	1	0	28	1	I have a lot of sympathy for ex-convicts, but I still favor the death penalty.	I am very conservative and I am opposed to abortion and the death penalty.
2.666666667	14127	4690	53	54	3	3	1	1	You need to find lots more for the death penalty to save more lives than innocents that have been executed by it.	People have been found out to be innocent after the death penalty ha already been carried out....
1	7933	25683	117	81	1	0	0	3	Last time I checked, killing doesn't bring persons back to life, so the only reason for the death penalty seems to be revenge.	>_> Says the person who brought up freaking Nelson in a debate about the death penalty for murders.
2.333333333	33642	5572	20	145	3	1	7	1	In the case of the death penalty, the crime committed is so terrible that society is no longer concerned with teaching a lesson; they simply want to be free of these terrible criminals.	Criminals need to be punished for what they have done.
4.333333333	1676	1676	44	35	1	2	4	1	Therefore the argument of death as a deterent is a joke.	The death penalty should not be catagorized as a deterrent.
3	7933	7933	62	11	1	7	0	1	Though I would not call the death penalty murder, I am personally against it.	I have been a victim of rape and if I were a victim of murder I would not desire the death penalty for the perpetrator.
4	4690	5572	32	181	1	1	1	1	How many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent?	So should we be able to impose the sentence of life without parole, all the while understanding that we may have put an innocent man in prison for life?
1	14127	3271	43	88	3	1	1	1	The way I see it, capital punishment doesn't have to be expensive at all.	I do believe in the death Penalty, eye for and eye.
5	373	33045	5	77	1	2	0	3	If someone is wrongly convicted of a crime and put in jail, they can be released if they're found to be innocent.	If we sentence someone to life in prison, we can always free them at a later time if they are found to be innocent.

1.666666667	25683	28050	112	178	3	6	0	3	The death penalty right now is to easy even I think.	I think only certain people deserve to have the death penalty.
1	17	2358	64	17	1	2	4	1	After we get through that, if he still retains the death penalty, it's a lot cheaper to kill him than to keep him up 'til he dies in prison.	If someone keeps killing and killing and killing, we need to stop him from taking lives.
1.666666667	31664	4774	24	53	3	1	9	1	As it is today, when someone murderers another, the death penalty is considered, as it should be.	I also don't think someone has been put to death for a third degree murder.
3	4756	7933	68	74	1	18	1	1	My point was that there are ways of dealing with violent criminals, murderers even, without executing them.	They support it because killing murderers is the right thing to do.
1	3065	17	74	124	1	16	0	1	I would support the death penalty IF there was a way to ensure that it would not put innocent people to death.	So, the only reason I can really see why people support the death penalty is to have simple vengeance against the perpretrator.
1.666666667	14127	823	79	12	3	4	1	1	As of yet, we have not seen fact one that even one innocent person has been put to death.	the use of the death penalty is an act of revenge which cannot be undone, so should the state be put on trial for putting to death an innocent person?
1.333333333	17	373	134	28	1	2	3	1	Oh, and by the way, the criteria that I mentioned earlier was enough to kill someone for treason, so why shouldn't it be enough to kill someone for another crime?	killing a person, no matter the reason, is still murder.
3	25683	25683	86	67	3	3	10	3	If the execution rate decreased and the murder rate increased then that explains the deterrence effect of capital punishment.	Implementing the death penalty will not eliminate it but help to reduce the rate of crime.
1.333333333	18153	33045	11	30	3	0	12	3	There is no way that I believe it is okay to execute innocent people because of a flawed system.	I think there should be a death penalty because, all those innocent people getting killed for no damn reason is unfair.
1	31664	2652	30	12	3	1	5	1	Like I said, if the person isn't convicted, then they will not be murdered in the electric chair, or by lethal injection.	I say that they should be killed the same way that the person(s) that they killed were.
1	33045	12024	38	1	3	21	1	3	I don't think everyone should be put to death.	I don't even give a shit about the death penalty, I was just making a point.
1	4690	5572	99	263	1	0	5	1	The person having been convicted of a crime punishable by death and subsequently sentenced to death should be put to death.	Acutally, long ago, the executioner was a convict also sentenced to death.
1.333333333	17	4690	44	42	1	5	8	1	(If a murderer is released and murders again, that has nothing to do with the death penalty, rather the sentencing laws, so doesn't contribute to the number of lives saved by the death penalty).	"The death penalty was included in that ""law."""
1.333333333	30812	25683	1	110	3	2	0	3	I see no point in letting someone live who does not want to live, or letting someone die who does not want to die.	If I die, I want to go out by firing squad.
1	33045	28050	38	178	3	21	0	3	The death penalty right now is to easy even I think.	I don't even give a shit about the death penalty, I was just making a point.
1	9059	7651	27	130	1	13	4	1	Gun owners don't drive into crowds of people simply because they had a gun in their car.	You have been shown the facts that most criminals get their guns from family members or they steal them, even from cops.
1.333333333	10783	9259	47	15	1	1	0	1	No, but they might like to challenge the conclusion that states with less strict firearm laws are more often the source of guns used in crimes, in other states, than guns from states with stricter gun laws.	In some states, some guns are just not allowed and it sticks as a law.
1.333333333	1103	8368	42	52	1	2	8	1	I fail to see how asking about gun ownership is any different.	I can understand your belief that gun control won't work and that owning guns is a good thing, I don't agree with it, but is hardly beyond comprehension.
1.333333333	674	657	5	46	1	21	10	1	Simple if gun haters want people defending the right to bear arms to be in militias, why would you want the militias to have lesser weapons then the enemies they are defending against?	Gun haters are the extremist hate group demanding to ban the right to bear arms!
3.666666667	657	185	65	19	1	1	0	1	Gun haters will stop when the right to bear arms is banned!	Now if you want gun control laws that limit or ban the right to bear arms you are a gun haters.
1	10273	8015	30	1	1	6	0	1	Ian brought up the point that guns make you more likely to kill a person.	You can't be a man unless you're swinging a gun, and no matter how many guns you buy, it's still missing for you .
1.333333333	7964	4400	16	204	1	5	4	1	It's just that on these forums, the words 'gun control' usually refer to extremely tight gun laws, or outright banning of guns.	It is legal to own weapons in this country, they are just tightly controlled, and as a result we have far less gun crime (particularly where it's not related to organised crime).
1	8053	7482	1	18	1	4	9	1	Only why would you need gun registration if guns were illegal?	So if you want to ban guns, 1,531,764 people will get killed or injured, and you'll only take guns out of the hands of those who don't even commit gun crimes.
1	9037	10057	261	115	1	67	7	1	If a gun owner knowingly sells to a prohibited felon who commits a murder with the gun, then the felon alone is responsible for the murder.	If more guns present means that more criminals will be able to commit more killings and violent criminals, wouldn't they have allowed the ban to remain in place?
1	9507	7969	44	3	1	1	0	1	It amasses me how many anti-gun nut activists have armed guards.	I implied that there are people with guns that are nuts, not that all gun owners are nuts...
4.666666667	8858	9841	86	34	1	8	13	1	Amendment protects the right of the states to arm their militias.	The 2nd amendment only protects a states right to own a Militia.
1	3029	8387	22	15	1	0	1	1	Gun control should be left to the person holding the gun.	Loose control of his firearm to a person who does not have the right to be in posession of the firearm.
1	10229	9009	31	99	1	7	7	1	The states with the higher numbers of minorities have the higher rates of gun control because they claim they have more crime.	While proximity to the border appears to be a major factor affecting which states are top sources, controlling for population reveals that even among the Southwest border states, certain states export crime guns to Mexico at disproportionately higher rates.
2	640	6651	9	7	1	1	68	1	It is asserted, therefore, that the D.C. gun control laws irrationally prevent only law abiding citizens from owning handguns.	Your advocating total violation of the constitution to prevent criminals from stealing guns from law abiding citizens.
1	5817	37757	14	29	1	7	3	3	If anything, cops will come to where you live to take your guns, seeing as they work for the government.	If individual citizens should not, in your view, be permitted to own firearms, them make your case and let the amendment process work to make your view the law of the land.
1	160	8004	8	76	1	7	10	1	You're right that gun control isn't about guns, however, but 'control' is a secondary matter, a means to an end.	Gun Control does not work, well unless you mean by working that crime sky rockets in which case I would have to agree with you and then question your motives as to why you would want it here.
3.333333333	1131	1131	42	28	1	1	0	1	Gun free zones are zones where law-abiding citizens are forbidden to have guns because law-abiding citizens obey the law about gun free zones.	Unarmed law-abiding citizens are victims of gun crimes because criminals do not obey the gun ban in that gun free zone.
1	1103	7482	46	7	1	6	21	1	That most people can't be trusted, so we should have more laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.	They didn't shoot someone because they were criminals, they because criminals because they shot someone, Your point boils down to 'Laws do not work because people disobey them-we should have no laws'.
1	8025	9145	29	2	1	1	1	1	Or that someone has pointed out that gun rights advocates seem to have been panic-buying firearms in case the White House bans them?	Since they've never done this it's only safe to assume that they hate absolutely any kind of gun and want them all banned outright without exception.
1	7929	2686	95	5	1	0	1	1	In England, where currently the private ownership of hand guns by the law abiding is absolutely prohibited, crimes involving the use of guns are rapidly increasing: only the criminals have access to them.	A law-abiding gun nut who uses their gun in committing a crime, is a criminal, and not law-abiding.
4	4400	9827	26	28	1	8	3	1	Name me one gun control law that has been effective as crime control!!!!!!	Gun control in the U.S. does not equal crime control.
1.333333333	8053	10011	40	240	1	9	4	1	We have a right to use a gun to defend ourselves and others.	We measured firearm protection as an attempted or completed crime in which the victim reported using a gun to attack or threaten an offender.
1	534	173	64	98	1	7	4	1	Gun haters are like the dangerous criminals the gun haters want to keep guns away from.	A criminal with a gun will feel a lot more confident in committing a crime than a criminal without a gun will just as a criminal will avoid those who have guns and target those who don't.
4	657	674	65	5	1	1	21	1	Gun haters are the extremist hate group demanding to ban the right to bear arms!	Now if you want gun control laws that limit or ban the right to bear arms you are a gun haters.
1.333333333	8182	2280	118	5	1	1	5	2	While their by no means should be an outlaw of guns, I do believe restrictions should be put in place.	I haven't seen anyone explain how another gun control law will fight crime, how it'll make anyone safer, how it'll put criminals away longer, etc.
1	9496	10098	15	145	1	7	1	1	Please show me what law prevents amending the constitution to repeal another amendment.	I have to wonder what incorporation under the XIVth amendment will do to all the knee jerk laws that were passed as crime control and is proven bad law already.
2	1073	7991	45	22	1	1	1	1	Its liberals like you who make it easy for criminals to get their hands on guns and liberals like you who make it possible for them to be used in the murders for which your nation is famed.	Do you think that a gun-ban in the long run would mean that more criminals get their hands on guns or that less criminals get their hands on guns?
2.333333333	8891	9463	2	12	1	14	2	1	If this is the case, then gun laws have a provable effect on how 'armed' criminals are - more gun control = less gun-carrying criminals, fact.	Private citizens can never hope to acquire firearms when gun control laws exist, but all 'criminals' have instant connections to black-market arms dealers.
2.666666667	2927	10199	82	79	1	2	8	1	You guys have willed yourselves just as retarded as the people who claimed (And still claim) that the second amendment only conveys a right for the national guard to have weapons.	Some passionately assert that the Amendment protects an individual's right to own guns.
1	339	534	29	95	1	8	4	1	If that means gun control then so be it, but it does not.	"Finally it mentions that Swiss ""gun control"" is not the reason for the low crime rates and, granted, it also mentions that this system is not proof that more guns means less crime."
1	1145	546	66	126	1	2	26	1	If you want to end gun deaths you can eliminate the guns and in the US that saves a lot of lives on paper.	The fact that you like cars is why you will tolerate the fact that more kids are killed by cars then guns.
2	4813	10229	8	10	1	5	30	1	This is the same logic the gun control supporters apply to people exercising their Second Amendment rights.	They argue that the second amendment allows the people the power of weapons so that if the government intrudes on their rights they can defend themselves.
2.333333333	173	28080	106	443	1	48	0	3	Making guns illegal wouldn't solve anything except to take them away from people that want to defend themselves.	In my view I think that complete gun control helps solve a major problem in crime and it would allow people to feel safer because they wouldn't need to have a gun to protect themselves.
1.666666667	28080	123	24	11	3	33	4	1	Most violent crime with guns occurs at knife fighting range.	Knives are used almost as often if not more so in crimes than are guns, the reason nobody is pushing to ban knives is because knives don't have the same negative cultural association guns have.
1	7840	8368	37	25	1	4	0	1	The only time in my life I have seen someone who owned a gun use it against some one they got into an argument with was when that person was under the influence of drugs and alcohol.	This appeared to me to be an argument that self defense cannot exist if a gun is used.
2.666666667	1194	1131	3	89	1	14	5	1	You propose to abolish gun free zones, and allow people to carry guns into schools.	I think laws stating that you should not be allowed to carry guns onto airplanes or into schools are examples of common sense gun control laws meant to protect people.
3.333333333	8701	8858	45	211	1	1	6	1	You say that gun control must not be effective because the study's conclusions about gun control were inconclusive.	"So an article that is entitled ""Gun control doesn't reduce crime, violence, say studies"" is not claiming that gun control is ineffective?"
1.333333333	28080	10352	443	28	3	0	3	1	So if its cause people in high crime areas want to buy guns for protection then why do they only want protection against gun murders but not other crimes.	Making guns illegal wouldn't solve anything except to take them away from people that want to defend themselves.
1	28080	1145	57	66	3	2	2	1	The fact that you like cars is why you will tolerate the fact that more kids are killed by cars then guns.	sure you can kill with other things, but most homicide weapons are guns.
1.333333333	7780	7840	113	3	1	6	9	1	That will take the criminals off the street and with them off the street there are no gun control concerns.	Gun control makes criminals lives much easier, because they can keep their guns, while they don't have to deal with armed citizens.
2.666666667	28080	28080	581	234	3	6	14	3	Guns don't kill people, people kill people: absolutely true, but guns allow people to kill people with greater efficiency, which is not necessarily a good thing outside of the battlefield.	it isn't guns that kill people, is the mentality these people carry around in their heads that kill other people.
1	7507	8777	8	27	1	1	0	1	If we look at D.C. we can see that people who had registered their guns before the gun ban were allowed to keep their guns after the ban took effect.	I think it is interesting that gun nuts always claim that when guns are banned people will just use knives instead, yet we find that with guns prohibited there are still only 200 deaths a year from knife like weapons.
3.666666667	9513	9841	23	34	1	22	13	1	Amendment protects the right of the states to arm their militias.	"The embraced anti-gun rights interpretation of the 2nd was that it was a provision that had but one function and intent, to protect the ""state right"" to organize and control their militia from federal interference."
1.333333333	28080	9919	415	3	3	4	1	1	The only way to prevent guns from falling in the hands of criminals is by law abiding people buying every gun that is manufactured and thus leaving no guns available for criminals to buy.	Something else you must keep in mind is that if we outlaw guns, the only people with guns will be outlaws, this leaves no defense for law abiding citizens.
3.666666667	1073	28080	35	190	1	3	3	3	It is just a case of prevention, remove guns being so easily accessible and you then decrease the gun crime and remove the need for guns to defend yourself.	Although I think a gun-ban should be effective since you can�t eliminate criminality entirely, and it�s the criminals, lunatics and otherwise unbalanced people that you don�t want to have guns or have an easy time getting guns.
4.666666667	4400	2280	390	22	1	3	0	2	THE SECOND AMENDMENT- A well regulated militia,being necessary to the security of a free state,the right of the people to keep and bear arms,shall not be infringed.PERIOD.	The Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States America states that, ���A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.�۝
3.333333333	764	1103	140	25	1	21	0	1	This is just as unrealistic a view that saying gun laws will prevent all crime- of course some criminals will not obey the law- that is what makes them criminals!	Why do people that want what they call reasonable limits on the right to bear arms believe criminals will obey a law stating criminals cannot have guns?
3.333333333	8891	7543	2	30	1	14	0	3	It's pointless people with criminal backgrounds aren't buying guns from gun stores (all of which already run background checks) there are no background checks on the black market and laws won't change that.	Private citizens can never hope to acquire firearms when gun control laws exist, but all 'criminals' have instant connections to black-market arms dealers.
1	8284	173	44	106	1	3	54	1	We have more crime than fully armed countries not because we don't have guns.	I could easily point out how many people are killed by criminals because they aren't armed and able to fight back, and that could be seen as grounds for removing the restrictive gun laws we have in this country.
1.666666667	185	28080	26	248	1	8	24	3	there are too many gun deaths and while there will never be a ban in America i find it appalling that so many fight to prevent gun restrictions and background checks.	If gun bans worked there would be no gun deaths in the countries that have banned guns.
3	4469	9601	9	14	1	6	6	1	All that does is imply that crime rate depends on more than just the presence/absence of guns - it disproves 'more guns = more crime' about as much as it disproves 'more guns = less crime'.	Some people who want to ban guns try to use simplistic arguments to suggest that murder rates are tied to the number of guns available for criminal misuse; and they suggest more guns = more crime and less guns = less crime.
1	2357	9054	43	22	1	30	8	1	So if you support every amendment made to the constitution pertaining to guns, than I submit your not to interested in owning a gun.	If you choose to not be prepared and not own a gun, that is your choice, you do not however have the right to tell me that I may not.
1	9955	546	64	187	1	2	14	1	I also say that when people commit a crime with a gun these people need to be punished not the law-abiding citizens!	As said,I think the people of the USA are quite capable of deciding about their own gun laws without a Brit getting involved but to make guns freely available to British citizens would be a bad, bad idea.
1	407	1103	5	46	1	5	6	1	They didn't shoot someone because they were criminals, they because criminals because they shot someone, Your point boils down to 'Laws do not work because people disobey them-we should have no laws'.	Not only will the criminals still have access to guns, but they will also have the added knowledge that either the person they intend to rob does not have a gun or they are breaking the law.
3	1445	28080	4	378	2	3	5	3	There is no reason law-abiding citizens need to defend themselves as they are untrained, do not have full knowledge of the law and eventually cause more harm than good by owning such weapons.	Gee, maybe if the law abiding had guns they could defend themselves?
1.666666667	9105	673	1	1	1	121	3	1	Ok, so are the gun haters claiming the police department are giving the guns criminals use for crime back to the criminals?	Police cannot do this, and indeed do not themselves even claim to be able to do so.
1.333333333	10011	8143	156	33	1	1	4	1	Guns are used in friendly and legal competitions, guns put food on peoples table through means of hunting, guns save lives through defensive uses.	Concealed carry laws put more legal guns on the street, in stores, etc. the is More Guns on the street for defensive use.
1.333333333	9009	8858	95	34	1	9	22	1	Also once you become an agent of the government you stop having right, you have authorities and you're controlled by the people the Constitution is supposed to protect you against.	You still have to prove that gun control equals crime control and your admission that it does not is proof that it is about control and dependency on government to protect you when they have no obligation to do so.
3	10098	28080	104	425	1	39	1	3	Do not ban guns when guns are the tools of man.	People like Brady blame the gun and say because one man uses a gun to harm someone then no one can be trusted with guns.
1.333333333	36399	18549	24	40	3	2	13	3	I like how anti gun people say we need to protect everyone from the rare gun events by banning guns, but when someone suggests banning the more frequent hammer and club attacks, they can justify those deaths.	if one wants to own a gun i have no qualms with them but if they wish to own guns such as a AK47 and AK74u they should be dealt with in a more civilized manner to protect the people.
2.666666667	4400	9320	5	96	1	4	6	1	Yes, that must be the reason why in other developed nations where there are more restrictions on guns less defenseless people are being murdered by criminals.	In short, Norway has more guns, yet less people killing each other.
1.333333333	975	673	11	1	1	3	8	1	The only gun control law that is needed is the law that prohibits a person from committing a crime with a gun.	The people that want gun control laws are the ones using the militia lie.
2.666666667	2606	1461	2	45	1	2	12	1	Basically, The US Curcuit Court upheld that the Second Amendment didn't apply to weapons that couldn't be carried by an individual.	In the Miller case, the court essentially ruled that the second ammendment does indeed convey an individual right, but that the right in question is dependant on the type of weapon (i.e must be suitable for military use).
4.666666667	1103	30649	34	7	1	3	0	3	Gun control laws only control the guns in the hands of people who follow laws.	Gun control laws do not affect criminals because criminals do not obey these laws.
1.666666667	8053	25798	1	63	1	4	29	3	Therefore you feel more guns is the solution to stopping gun crime.	So if you want to ban guns, 1,531,764 people will get killed or injured, and you'll only take guns out of the hands of those who don't even commit gun crimes.
1	546	10199	153	28	1	17	15	1	"I want to see, in the Constitution, where government has an affirmative duty to protect anyone much less ""ensure that felons and other prohibited persons do not possess firearms."	I think the government has taken responsibility for the law abiding citizens by ensuring that nobody can carry a gun or other dangerous weapon on board a plane.
2	407	8541	5	8	1	5	0	1	NATO, Galileo has claimed that these laws are designed to reduce criminal use of guns (which would have to mean that they target the people, not the guns).	Not only will the criminals still have access to guns, but they will also have the added knowledge that either the person they intend to rob does not have a gun or they are breaking the law.
1	9919	1543	1	108	1	56	2	1	Using a shotgun or an AK-47 will get the job done, so I don't see the need to ban assault weapons.	I believe in gun control (and wrote this piece to satirize pro-gunners) because I hate guns and want to see them all banned, which is why I own guns and also enjoy reading firearms-related literature.
1	10622	8329	121	118	1	2	9	1	Federal law doesn't give them authority to require sale reports of multiple shotgun and rifle sales, only handguns.	One private individual asking another if they have guns in the home and then offering them a pamphlet on firearms safety if they say yes has nothing at all to do with gun control or the second amendment.
1	9059	36399	27	19	1	13	4	3	"Even ""If criminals keep their guns"",(if we were to confiscate all guns) "" they wont be able to use them."	You have been shown the facts that most criminals get their guns from family members or they steal them, even from cops.
1	28080	546	40	191	3	4	9	1	Felons are not allowed to buy guns.....terrorists would not be allowed to take guns on planes.	Gun ban = No civilians can protect themselves using a firearm = Criminals can illegally purchase guns, like tons already do.
2.333333333	10154	48	1	50	1	266	6	1	It was felt by many (not all) at the time that such weapons were not military weapons and thus did not fall under the protection of the Second Amendment or the right to bear arms in their own state constitutions.	The right to bear arms is protected by the Constitutions of Virginia and of the United States.
1.666666667	28080	28080	24	425	3	33	1	3	Do not ban guns when guns are the tools of man.	Knives are used almost as often if not more so in crimes than are guns, the reason nobody is pushing to ban knives is because knives don't have the same negative cultural association guns have.
1	407	185	5	20	1	5	4	1	They will not only confiscate the guns, but then charge the owners of those guns for being terrorists.

WE AGREE THAT CRIMINALS SHOULDN'T BE ARMED, and the laws already exist on the books to punish them when convicted criminals are caught with guns.

1	9919	640	5	9	1	1	1	1	Your advocating total violation of the constitution to prevent criminals from stealing guns from law abiding citizens.	The gun industry should be protected against lawsuits because criminal gun dealers who sell firearms to child killers are law abiding, model citizens according to the NRA.

1.666666667	9919	7543	3	30	1	1	0	3	It's pointless people with criminal backgrounds aren't buying guns from gun stores (all of which already run background checks) there are no background checks on the black market and laws won't change that.	The only way to prevent guns from falling in the hands of criminals is by law abiding people buying every gun that is manufactured and thus leaving no guns available for criminals to buy.
2	9095	296	1	4	1	11	2	1	Then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the US?	Within the United States, rural areas have higher rates of gun ownership and lower rates of murder, whites have higher rates of gun ownership than blacks and much lower murder rates.
1	9009	10282	107	7	1	3	0	1	But it appears that support for gun control is higher when people are asked about specific gun laws rather than just a general question about stricter gun control.	But the argument that stricter gun laws in areas with more people from minority groups shows that gun control is racist is also entirely circumstantial.
2	160	10351	8	11	1	7	1	1	So I think gun control on the magnitude you want would effect it, how could it not?	Gun Control does not work, well unless you mean by working that crime sky rockets in which case I would have to agree with you and then question your motives as to why you would want it here.
2.666666667	9099	9463	123	7	1	4	0	1	There's no evidence to prove the believe that when guns are less available, less criminals will be armed than if guns were more readily available.	Rather, if firearms availability does matter, the data consistently show that the way it matters is that more guns equal less violent crime.

1.333333333	8711	9211	163	29	1	3	1	1	First you say no law will ever stop criminals from getting guns but now youre saying that criminals are never gun owners.

2.333333333	7651	6729	110	12	1	2	7	1	Once again, there is a curious drive to blame the legal firearm owner vs the criminal.	If a criminal steals a legally purchased gun from a law abiding gun owner, we are still faced with a situation where the criminal's actions and intent are to blame, not the gun itself.

3	8182	296	131	62	1	0	2	1	Gun haters think banning guns will make criminals stop being criminals.	Supporting gun control to stop violent criminals, is like supporting a ban on cameras to stop child pornography.
2.666666667	9191	12361	19	76	1	2	3	3	This should be a clear indicator that legal ownership of guns in no way has increased potential criminality for law abiding citizens.	The logic of less guns in law abiding citizens hands means less gun crime is clearly insane.
2.333333333	28080	9259	179	15	3	1	0	1	No, but they might like to challenge the conclusion that states with less strict firearm laws are more often the source of guns used in crimes, in other states, than guns from states with stricter gun laws.

1.666666667	10098	43	170	4	1	2	8	1	Since I have taken care to point out that there are Constitutional objections, and you have concurred, I'll assume you will also permit me to pretend that there is no 2nd Amendment.	Now when you rightfully talk about how the 2nd amendment grants me the right to own a gun people won't take you seriously because you think the 2nd amendment cannot be repealed.

So now you're saying that just because somebody owns a gun, they're somehow more likely to start killing people than somebody who doesn't own a gun?
1	8777	11028	97	212	1	1	4	1	What it seems like you are claiming is that if the owner would otherwise let you in if you didn't have a gun, you have a right to go in by the 2nd amendment.

2	589	8004	67	17	1	2	2	1	The medium of 'free speech' has changed, but that does not affect that free speech should still exist - just as with the other constitutional points (with a few exceptions, if you believe Bush).	Do you think that private companies should be able to restrict freedom of speech as well as any other parts of the constitution?
0.666666667	991	11028	5	232	2	0	2	1	I don't think it's so much the media as the fact that no one is used to seeing people with guns, so when they do they assume they are in the middle of a combat zone.	I don't believe guns are good for anything, and I see no use in having them, but I believe it is everybody's right to produce or keep one, as it is just a weapon like anything else.
2	7780	9037	113	66	1	6	4	1	So guns kept in a home appear to attract criminals rather than deter them.	Gun control makes criminals lives much easier, because they can keep their guns, while they don't have to deal with armed citizens.

The gun control mentality that a felon is too dangerous to be allowed to legally buy a gun, yet they're not dangerous enough to take out of the public no matter how heinous a crime they've committed.
4.666666667	1103	296	30	101	1	4	0	1	Gun control will not work because criminals do not obey gun control laws.	Gun control laws do not stop criminals from getting guns.
2	179	546	4	96	1	0	2	1	Therefore, we should not allow anyone to carry a gun on a plane, because these people may either be law abiding or not.	I think law abiding citizens should be allowed to carry conceled weapons.
3.333333333	657	565	65	24	1	1	17	1	Gun haters will do any thing to ban the right to bear arms!	Now if you want gun control laws that limit or ban the right to bear arms you are a gun haters.
4	296	1103	102	34	1	2	3	1	Gun control laws do not affect criminals because criminals do not obey these laws.	Criminals that do not obey gun control laws will be able to obtain guns and use them on the unarmed law-abiding citizens.
3	10154	10145	35	72	1	10	17	1	They never said anything about allowing bans on commonly owned firearms, or ammunition, or allowing for heinous restrictions that wouldn't be considered constitutional when applied to other rights.

Those are all the government, if it has gotten as far as the people, and the government (the president, the congress, the supreme court) has decided on gun control, who's going to arrest them for it?
3	25798	28080	63	190	3	29	3	3	It is just a case of prevention, remove guns being so easily accessible and you then decrease the gun crime and remove the need for guns to defend yourself.	Therefore you feel more guns is the solution to stopping gun crime.
3.666666667	4400	669	390	24	1	3	11	1	It is the right of the people (not of persons) that shall not be infringed, the right stated in the Virginia Constitution to train the body of the people in arms in order to defend the free state.

3.333333333	7780	38588	113	4	1	6	4	3	I see, so banning guns just stops law abiding citizens from having them, yet your family of criminals buys them from people who legally obtained them, or has them legally obtained for them.	Gun control makes criminals lives much easier, because they can keep their guns, while they don't have to deal with armed citizens.
2.666666667	185	667	19	3	1	0	13	1	Gun hater Sarah Brady like al gun hater blame the right to bear arms for the crimes committed with guns.	Gun haters will stop when the right to bear arms is banned!
1	820	9394	20	191	1	6	15	1	For that matter, why not arrest people for breaking any gun law, not just those relating to handguns?	That is exactly what will happen with new gun control, the people who break the existing laws will mere just scoff at the new ones.
2.666666667	9009	9224	36	36	1	2	4	1	Gun grabbers are criminal because they advocate eliminating the Second Amendment.	It took the 14th amendment for them to get the right to keep and bear arms and still today the gun grabber agenda is based on denial of rights, all rights and not just Second Amendment rights.
1.333333333	9955	8008	108	22	1	11	10	1	Again, I don't think anybody will argue that owning a gun prevents crime.	,   and I was being kind when I say there was no change in the murder rate, The Anti-gun argument was that at least England�۪s gun control will stop mass shootings.
1.333333333	28080	8035	57	116	3	2	1	1	Are you saying that since all guns have been banned for civilian use in Countries like England, that murders by guns and gun crimes have gone to absolute zero there?	sure you can kill with other things, but most homicide weapons are guns.
1	8858	8004	211	76	1	6	10	1	You're right that gun control isn't about guns, however, but 'control' is a secondary matter, a means to an end.	You say that gun control must not be effective because the study's conclusions about gun control were inconclusive.
3	7840	9152	37	102	1	4	1	1	There is no debate as none of you have offered evidence that in Australia it's illegal to use your firearms in self-defense.	This appeared to me to be an argument that self defense cannot exist if a gun is used.
2.666666667	8636	8636	157	172	1	15	1	1	Whether or not he is a felon, if you give someone a gun knowing they intend to commit a particular crime with it then you are responsible as an accessory before the fact.	Confession from the criminal or videotaping the transaction, or someone providing testimony that you, in fact, knew that he was a criminal, prohibited from owning a firearm, and you intended to break the law.
1.333333333	28080	25130	161	38	3	2	2	3	...Virtually never are murderers the ordinary, law-abiding people against whom gun bans are aimed.	Guns are becoming more easier to purchase and people are becoming more insane.humans are killing more innocent people everyday!
1	8123	10352	8	28	1	3	3	1	So if its cause people in high crime areas want to buy guns for protection then why do they only want protection against gun murders but not other crimes.	If gun control will not affect criminal ownership of guns and people will always be able to get a firearm if they want, why should a government make the effort to ban firearms as a precursor to atrocities?
2.333333333	7507	12361	21	48	1	3	8	3	If most gun crimes are committed by illegal firearm holders then it means that legal ownership of firearms combined with government monitoring can have a positive effect.	To inact a law that makes a crime of illegal gun ownership has no effect on criminal ownership of guns.
1.666666667	7507	28080	8	425	1	1	1	3	Do not ban guns when guns are the tools of man.	I think it is interesting that gun nuts always claim that when guns are banned people will just use knives instead, yet we find that with guns prohibited there are still only 200 deaths a year from knife like weapons.
1	10060	7482	82	18	1	21	9	1	Only why would you need gun registration if guns were illegal?	The 2nd Amendment is not there to entitle you to all of the gun control you want!
2.333333333	38588	339	5	63	3	2	24	1	Law abiding citizens are not going to misuse their firearms and those with criminal records are already banned from owning guns.	Criminals don't care about gun bans, so a gun ban only takes guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens.
2.666666667	10301	9913	15	84	1	63	12	1	You're not allowed to assemble your gun, not even in event of a break in, you're not allowed to load it, or take it from one room of your house to another.	In such cases you are protecting against a violent felony offense which endangers your life and anyone else in the home, and you are then allowed to use deadly force to defend your home.

4.333333333	185	185	26	26	1	8	9	1	Since there are gun deaths in countries that have banned guns, the gun bans did not work.	If gun bans worked there would be no gun deaths in the countries that have banned guns.

2.666666667	5349	10445	29	2	1	14	19	1	Do you understand that any proposed gun control law must pass the strict scrutiny test due to the Second Amendment being recognized as a fundamental right protected by the Constitution?	Even in the Emerson case although the court recognized the Second Amendment as protecting an individual right they didn't apply strict scrutiny (something that would be required if they were dealing with a fundamental right).
1.333333333	9096	28080	1	40	1	30	4	3	Gun ban = No civilians can protect themselves using a firearm = Criminals can illegally purchase guns, like tons already do.	FACT: Because it is already illegal for convicted felons to own guns, the Fifth Amendment protects felons from being forced to incriminate themselves by registering their guns.
3	10041	8105	22	68	1	11	8	1	so the NRA is so stupid to believe that the second amendment means terrorists can tote around assault rifles	It's absurd to think that the Second Amendment was intended to protect a right to commit a crime.
2.333333333	160	10011	8	173	1	7	4	1	You are pulling the same XXXX Doc did in thinking that because I don't think more guns equals less crime that I automatically must think it means MORE crime and that gun control laws are effective and needed.	Gun Control does not work, well unless you mean by working that crime sky rockets in which case I would have to agree with you and then question your motives as to why you would want it here.
1.666666667	173	623	98	29	1	4	7	1	But gun hater pilot will demand that the right to bear arms be limited or banned to keep criminals from getting guns.	Gun haters are like the dangerous criminals the gun haters want to keep guns away from.
1.666666667	10149	8636	6	121	1	3	9	1	Gun controllers make us conclude that they are being disingenuous, and even using these crime factors to further their aim of more and more and more and even more gun control.	Or, to put it another way, more guns = more crime, and if we could stop the illegal gun running then we would have less guns = less crime.
1	1145	10461	66	30	1	2	20	1	You would rather be confronted by a guy with a baseball bat because you are FAR more likely to get killed by the guy with the gun.	The fact that you like cars is why you will tolerate the fact that more kids are killed by cars then guns.
1.666666667	25798	565	63	1	3	29	17	1	So anti-gunners please stop trying to find creative ways to control gun crime, crime, and avoid the Constitution.	Therefore you feel more guns is the solution to stopping gun crime.
1	8543	10098	197	376	1	9	12	1	Illegal firearms can be identified and linked to other firearms and to crimes and criminals.	So how is controlling the law-abiding going to help when murder is already illegal, it is already illegal for a convicted criminal to be even in the same room as a gun.
1	9037	36399	66	19	1	4	4	3	"Even ""If criminals keep their guns"",(if we were to confiscate all guns) "" they wont be able to use them."	So guns kept in a home appear to attract criminals rather than deter them.
1	25130	546	82	153	3	13	17	1	I think the government has taken responsibility for the law abiding citizens by ensuring that nobody can carry a gun or other dangerous weapon on board a plane.	where gun control laws prohibit good law abiding citizens from carrying a gun to protect themselves and others.
3.333333333	764	2417	140	72	1	21	2	1	Which is why the ban is a bit of a poor compromise, they've banned guns for law abiding people but they've not done enough to make sure criminals don't have them.	Why do people that want what they call reasonable limits on the right to bear arms believe criminals will obey a law stating criminals cannot have guns?
2	173	10060	78	82	1	17	21	1	The 2nd Amendment is not there to entitle you to all of the gun control you want!	So you have to read the 2nd amendment as a whole.

1	160	546	8	119	1	7	9	1	There are situations where I'll be more in control of my destiny without a gun and you corner yourself and lost complete control of your destiny because of your gun.	Gun Control does not work, well unless you mean by working that crime sky rockets in which case I would have to agree with you and then question your motives as to why you would want it here.
1	8636	10847	157	5	1	15	279	1	But that does not change the fact that the law has made the individual into a prohibited person, so that her gun possession is, in itself, a federal felony.	Confession from the criminal or videotaping the transaction, or someone providing testimony that you, in fact, knew that he was a criminal, prohibited from owning a firearm, and you intended to break the law.
1	10273	8004	30	76	1	6	10	1	You're right that gun control isn't about guns, however, but 'control' is a secondary matter, a means to an end.	You can't be a man unless you're swinging a gun, and no matter how many guns you buy, it's still missing for you .
3.333333333	1131	1131	90	37	1	4	1	1	Gun free zones are areas that criminals enter with guns because they know they are no armed law-abiding citizens there to stop them.	All gun free zones can do, is keep law-abiding citizens from having guns.
1	10199	8004	260	76	1	6	10	1	You're right that gun control isn't about guns, however, but 'control' is a secondary matter, a means to an end.	What you've been doing isn't a debate about gun control, it's criticism of the Supreme Court for saying the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own a gun for legal purposes.
1	296	28080	62	443	1	5	0	3	Making guns illegal wouldn't solve anything except to take them away from people that want to defend themselves.	People that defend the right to bear arms that demand laws that punish criminals by keeping them in prison thus keeping guns away from them.
1	10011	8682	173	11	1	4	3	1	Right now it is against the law for the government to keep a database of gun owners, that that law would have to be changed, and I think you also know this.	You are pulling the same XXXX Doc did in thinking that because I don't think more guns equals less crime that I automatically must think it means MORE crime and that gun control laws are effective and needed.
2	173	6116	106	16	1	48	6	1	For instance I don't think that eliminating gun control is the only answer crime control is also needed.	In my view I think that complete gun control helps solve a major problem in crime and it would allow people to feel safer because they wouldn't need to have a gun to protect themselves.
3	28080	560	57	6	3	2	7	1	You can debate that without guns there would be more deaths to other weapons although you can't debate it would be to the same extent as gun murders and crimes would be.	sure you can kill with other things, but most homicide weapons are guns.
3.666666667	969	2280	11	22	1	17	0	2	THE SECOND AMENDMENT- A well regulated militia,being necessary to the security of a free state,the right of the people to keep and bear arms,shall not be infringed.PERIOD.	2) ensure that the right to keep and bear arms for a militia is not infringed.
1.333333333	8182	9211	55	29	1	1	1	1	First you say no law will ever stop criminals from getting guns but now youre saying that criminals are never gun owners.	So by you saying tourists are afraid to come to America because they might get shot in one of our cities, implies that gun owners are participating in criminal activities as well.
3.666666667	1131	1131	39	88	1	1	2	1	Criminals will not be stopped from taking guns into gun free zones because criminals do not obey laws!	Gun free zones are areas where law-abiding citizens are forbidden to carry guns by law.
4	623	674	94	5	1	27	20	1	All of the gun control laws the gun haters want will only be obeyed by the law abiding citizens!	Simple if the gun haters did not want your guns why do gun haters only want gun control laws that law abiding citizens obey and criminals do not?
2	9014	7651	52	130	1	1	4	1	Gun owners don't drive into crowds of people simply because they had a gun in their car.	Most gun owners are just ordinary people who happen to own a firearm.
3.333333333	1103	7651	23	63	1	34	3	1	First, the ruling was that the Second Amendment only applied to firearms that had a militia purposes and that the sawed-off shotgun in question didn't have any evidence of being suitable for a militia.	"If anything, it has ruled in favor of gun control, saying in the Miller case that ""The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia."""
1	10011	4400	190	154	1	1	2	1	Muggings, burglaries, rapes, assault and battery are all examples of violent crimes that don't require a gun.	"The opposite of ""more guns = less crime is not true"" is not ""more guns = more crime""."
3.666666667	9270	28080	74	234	1	10	14	3	Guns don't kill people, people kill people: absolutely true, but guns allow people to kill people with greater efficiency, which is not necessarily a good thing outside of the battlefield.	Sure you say guns don't kill people but people kill people, but the gun is only a tool or a means to that end.
1	8711	8777	163	97	1	3	1	1	You've made the argument that registration of firearms is perfectly legal and constitutional, despite the fact that the Firearm Owners Protection Act forbids any and all type of database of guns or gun owners.	Even back in the 60's gun owners were saying that if you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns, and gun safety being stressed, and maybe even mandatory for children will produce benefits.
1.333333333	28080	7840	536	3	3	0	9	1	That will take the criminals off the street and with them off the street there are no gun control concerns.	If guns would be made illegal, then only criminals would have them.
1.666666667	37757	37757	19	29	3	0	3	3	If anything, cops will come to where you live to take your guns, seeing as they work for the government.	Those are all the government, if it has gotten as far as the people, and the government (the president, the congress, the supreme court) has decided on gun control, who's going to arrest them for it?
2.333333333	9270	28080	74	516	1	10	0	3	people who want to kill, will kill if you ban guns, they will kill with knives, or something else.	Sure you say guns don't kill people but people kill people, but the gun is only a tool or a means to that end.
2	623	657	94	65	1	27	1	1	Now if you want gun control laws that limit or ban the right to bear arms you are a gun haters.	Simple if the gun haters did not want your guns why do gun haters only want gun control laws that law abiding citizens obey and criminals do not?
2.333333333	30649	28080	7	378	3	1	5	3	There is no reason law-abiding citizens need to defend themselves as they are untrained, do not have full knowledge of the law and eventually cause more harm than good by owning such weapons.	People who follow laws, aren't causing problems with the guns they own.
2.333333333	9919	476	5	15	1	16	2	1	Before the Brady Law any criminal could walk into a gun store and easily purchase a gun.	Criminals will always find ways to get around gun laws which is why there are a lot less criminals who own and use guns in places like the UK and Australia.
1.666666667	7929	8035	95	47	1	0	1	1	Gun ownership is a protected right, and the fact that criminals use guns in the commission of crime will never change this fact.	A law-abiding gun nut who uses their gun in committing a crime, is a criminal, and not law-abiding.
1.666666667	10735	673	67	1	1	12	8	1	The only gun control law that is needed is the law that prohibits a person from committing a crime with a gun.	One such person who is prohibited by federal law from having a firearm at all is the convicted felon:
3	2927	10735	33	22	1	1	8	1	The federal government has NO business dabbling in concealed carry regulation, unless they are going to declare it a protected activity under the second amendment.	"Why can a state attach limits ""in their own individual RKBA"" (such as prohibited concealed carry) that supercede the second amendment- unless the second amendment does not protect concealed carry."
1.333333333	2417	7780	28	115	1	26	5	1	Therefore, if you avoid gangs (those who tend to have guns - they are still criminals), there is little point in carrying a gun yourself.	Furthermore, as I am sure you are aware, the British police do not carry firearms, and they defend themselves equally well against attacks from criminals armed with lethal weapons.
3	10199	9820	260	23	1	13	1	1	The Second Amendment isn't a gun control law, it's an individual right, independent from militia service.	"The Second Amendment was never about individual gun ownership, it's only purpose was proper case of a government organized and controlled militia."""
3	28080	38588	297	5	3	0	2	3	Criminals don't care about gun bans, so a gun ban only takes guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens.	If today we were to ban guns all the law abiding citizens would give up their firearms and protection.
1.666666667	10395	8391	11	12	1	5	2	1	Private ownership of guns may indeed add to the number of weapons held by criminals, but it is not their major source of weapons.	Various groups have been unable to show that the criminal use of firearms leads to more deaths than the number of lives that are saved by private and legal gun ownership.
2.666666667	660	2927	10	30	1	1	12	1	(i.e. restrictions on concealed carry, laws against brandishing) but we can not ban the carrying of arms altogether since that would violate the second amendment.	1) Does having laws regulating the the ability to carry concealed weapons violate the 2nd amendment of the constitution?
1	8099	560	14	30	1	3	13	1	Gun haters must attack people defending the right to bear arms by calling them fanatics.	You're saying that guns should be allowed into school in order to allow some students (or teachers) to defend themselves if they were attacked.
2	4021	10098	14	41	1	3	0	1	Well, not all colleges are government institutions and our government has traditionally banned guns from certain locations not in violation of the 2nd amendment.	It involved a ban of guns within a certain proximity to schools.
2.666666667	10011	8003	190	16	1	1	1	1	You've accepted the first posit - that less guns will result in less gun killings.	"The opposite of ""more guns = less crime is not true"" is not ""more guns = more crime""."
2.666666667	28080	2046	111	4	3	5	2	1	In most studies legal purchases of firearms have no influence on the crime rate.	DC's highest gun deaths per capita coincidences with the fact that guns are legal there, doesn't mean anywhere guns are legal crime rates will be high.
2	9129	296	13	65	1	7	6	1	As for the second amendment and whether gun ownership is a right or a priviledge we can discuss later.	The only thing we've been over, is that government and gun control is racist, not the Second Amendment.
3.666666667	9099	9099	1	14	1	34	2	1	These laws are all part of the gun grabbers` wholesale attack on private gun ownership.	Yet this gun grabber group of drooling nit wits wants more laws that attack the law abiding.
2.333333333	10683	10098	49	55	1	3	0	1	Exactly how many shootings took place in these settings when students were allowed to not only bring their legally owned guns with them to school, but could also store them in their lockers inside the school?	It was in no way illegal for a student to keep their legally owned firearms on school property while attending class and then go hunting after they were finished for the day.
2.666666667	8329	10328	118	17	1	9	13	1	"Exactly how would multiple sales reports filed in rifle purchases qualify as ""the right thing?"""	Federal law doesn't give them authority to require sale reports of multiple shotgun and rifle sales, only handguns.
2	8636	8543	21	189	1	8	0	1	If you can afford a gun you should be able to afford a proper storage device.	You could argue that many in poverty cannot afford a gun as things currently stand.
2	9014	6777	11	59	1	5	7	1	Gun locks are designed to keep kids from playing with guns.	If my kid encounters a gun while playing at another's home I'll get involved in gun safety education.
2	1461	9009	8	36	1	9	2	1	It took the 14th amendment for them to get the right to keep and bear arms and still today the gun grabber agenda is based on denial of rights, all rights and not just Second Amendment rights.	If the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, or any of the other rights guaranteed by the Constitution are to be abridged, they must ne done so by legal means, i.e. constitutional amendment.
3	10847	975	5	30	1	359	40	1	No law shall impose licensure, registration or special taxation on the ownership or possession of firearms or ammunition.	"That is why current federal law specifically forbids registration of gun owners and guns and gun transactions: ""any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions."
1.666666667	28080	9827	40	26	3	4	35	1	Plus, if all firearms are illegal, and if one were to illegally obtain a gun, why not own and use automatic weapons, just like the gangs in England are using?	Gun ban = No civilians can protect themselves using a firearm = Criminals can illegally purchase guns, like tons already do.
2	669	9259	46	15	1	10	0	1	No, but they might like to challenge the conclusion that states with less strict firearm laws are more often the source of guns used in crimes, in other states, than guns from states with stricter gun laws.	The reality is that in developed nations with stricter gun laws than the US there are less outlaws owning and using guns.
3.666666667	534	546	21	96	1	1	2	1	Therefore, we should not allow anyone to carry a gun on a plane, because these people may either be law abiding or not.	I seriously cannot believe that someone out there really thinks that we should allow EVERYBODY to carry weapons onto an airplane!
3.666666667	9836	1103	61	30	1	0	4	1	Gun control laws do not stop criminals from getting guns.	It doesn't appear that gun control laws nor a strong government can stop gang nor criminal activity in any country, India nor Mexico.
2	7651	5818	110	1	1	2	5	1	Many thousands of Guns are stolen and used in GUN CREATED CRIME because most legal gun owners	If a criminal steals a legally purchased gun from a law abiding gun owner, we are still faced with a situation where the criminal's actions and intent are to blame, not the gun itself.
1	25130	8636	34	138	3	32	24	1	Maybe since we have a much higher concentration of homes with firearms than our fellow citizens in Cleveland, we can say guns are the cause of our low murder rate!	One of the reason we are the country we are is because of our right to own guns.
4	4400	8182	262	31	1	10	2	1	Cars kill people everyday just the same as guns, but nobody is trying to ban cars.	Also: More people are killed in car accidents than are killed by guns.
3.666666667	2417	30649	65	7	1	1	0	3	Gun control laws only control the guns in the hands of people who follow laws.	Gun control laws do not deprive gun ownership for those who do not follow laws.
2.666666667	10629	185	3	26	1	2	17	1	Gun haters if the 2nd amend did not protect the right to bear arms then all guns in America would be banned.	The second amendment is not primarily there to protect our right to keep hunting weapons.
3.333333333	10057	991	57	15	1	1	0	2	Yeah, thing is that the second ammendment makes the point that guns should be allowed because a _well organised militia_ is an important tool for a nation.	First you argued that the Second Amendment was a collective rights tool designed to ensure that each state had its own private militia.
1	28080	991	234	6	3	14	3	2	Many people who would never dream of shooting a person can own a gun simply for the artistry of a well made machine, people hunt with guns as well.	Guns don't kill people, people kill people: absolutely true, but guns allow people to kill people with greater efficiency, which is not necessarily a good thing outside of the battlefield.
2.666666667	10817	1660	64	77	1	9	4	1	The 2nd Amendment gives citizens the rights to own a gun, not the Militia Act.	I realize that these anti-gun rights historians need to impress upon the 2nd Amendment a militia regulating action but there is no legal evidence of the 2nd being inspected or held to inform upon any aspect of militia powers.
3	28080	10330	111	26	3	5	25	1	In short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns.	DC's highest gun deaths per capita coincidences with the fact that guns are legal there, doesn't mean anywhere guns are legal crime rates will be high.
2	9330	48	9	50	1	17	6	1	It was felt by many (not all) at the time that such weapons were not military weapons and thus did not fall under the protection of the Second Amendment or the right to bear arms in their own state constitutions.	The Second Amendment confers the right to bear arms, and earlier this year a U.S. Supreme Court ruling curtailed government's ability to regulate guns.
1.333333333	546	9320	119	98	1	5	6	1	My point was that the theory that more gun control leaves people defenseless does not explain the lower murder rates in other developed nations.	That would theoretically work except the fact that more knife murders may occur then and perhaps guns will be brought in illegally to murder people.
1.333333333	10003	9827	29	28	1	19	3	1	Name me one gun control law that has been effective as crime control!!!!!!	I really do not care particularly what gun control laws states or cities pass.
2.666666667	10376	9038	18	3	1	1	13	1	Here's the thing...the Second Amendment and the right to be armed for your own defense isn't just a right, it's a fundamental, human, and individual right.	It's also silly to argue that the Second Amendment only protects arms in common use.
1.666666667	10199	6509	64	38	1	2	5	1	The gun lobby likes to give lip service to the idea of rights and freedom but every time they oppose reasonable safety measures intended to protect people's rights they show where they really stand.	If you want any protection for your rights, you have to be able to present an argument outlining how they are being violated.
1.666666667	10229	8777	10	121	1	21	0	1	I for one do not say that registration of all privately held firearms would violate the constitution.	I'd love to see how gun rationing, ammunition documentation, ending private sales, gun registration, and restriction of right to carry, has helped reduce violence crimes and make things difficult for criminals.
3.333333333	8777	28080	16	57	1	2	0	3	all guns are used for is killing, they are weapons.	After all, since these lethal weapons are only used to kill or maim, the police must only carry them to kill or maim, huh?
1	8329	10474	118	1	1	9	8	1	I feel like existing laws need to actually be enforced and new ones targeted at those they are created for and not at legal law abiding gun owners.	Federal law doesn't give them authority to require sale reports of multiple shotgun and rifle sales, only handguns.
2	4813	6116	3	16	1	2	6	1	For instance I don't think that eliminating gun control is the only answer crime control is also needed.	I think a better debate would be when should gun control start?
1.333333333	8231	8929	33	100	1	14	6	1	And where laws were passed, the gun lobby has had success in watering those laws down.	That pretty much boiled down to laws against felons having weapons, laws against the mentally defective having weapons, and laws against carrying weapons in sensitive places.
2	10441	12892	8	1	1	29	0	3	Well, owning handguns for personal home protection is different that carrying guns in a concealed fashion for protection.	I don't even carry a gun concealed nor openly, but I have to defend what is right, just because it is right!
1	2417	546	58	96	1	6	2	1	Therefore, we should not allow anyone to carry a gun on a plane, because these people may either be law abiding or not.	We could hypothesize that if guns are banned then law abiding citizens who usually didn't carry or own guns before the ban will be less likely to face armed opponents.
1	10912	1543	3	108	1	1	2	1	Using a shotgun or an AK-47 will get the job done, so I don't see the need to ban assault weapons.	None are so fearful as those who need to have guns and more guns and more guns and more and more ammo, and assault weapons.
3	623	296	29	62	1	7	2	1	Gun haters think banning guns will make criminals stop being criminals.	But gun hater pilot will demand that the right to bear arms be limited or banned to keep criminals from getting guns.
4.333333333	623	674	47	5	1	9	20	1	All of the gun control laws the gun haters want will only be obeyed by the law abiding citizens!	The only people that obey gun control laws that prevent people from taking guns any where are law abiding people.
1	10441	339	8	72	1	29	7	1	I really can't do that if I don't have a gun do I. Your responsible for your own protection, not me.	I don't even carry a gun concealed nor openly, but I have to defend what is right, just because it is right!
1	28080	637	472	6	3	2	3	1	Of course if a hate groups such as the gun haters want to ban a right they will claim this!	We didn't ban all guns, just most of them, because our farmers need them and our police need them.

1	8065	8003	92	1	1	1	3	1	Also, you must note that politicians own guns themselves, and have armed bodyguards.	It doesnt say you have the right to shoot arms so it would be okay to ban bullets.
1	20890	8777	24	27	3	0	0	1	If we look at D.C. we can see that people who had registered their guns before the gun ban were allowed to keep their guns after the ban took effect.	If guns are banned, the only people that will be affected will be the people that buy guns for protection from criminals, who get their guns illegally anyway.
1.333333333	9580	8366	75	11	1	13	9	1	What stupid Americans like you don't understand is that revoking the Second Amendment wouldn't play any part on protecting anyone from criminals that're armed with guns.	You keep claiming that you're not of the anti-gun camp, that you actually support the Second Amendment.
1.333333333	1194	10003	3	29	1	14	19	1	I really do not care particularly what gun control laws states or cities pass.	I think laws stating that you should not be allowed to carry guns onto airplanes or into schools are examples of common sense gun control laws meant to protect people.
1.333333333	9580	10199	75	79	1	13	8	1	You guys have willed yourselves just as retarded as the people who claimed (And still claim) that the second amendment only conveys a right for the national guard to have weapons.	You keep claiming that you're not of the anti-gun camp, that you actually support the Second Amendment.
1	48	8190	27	20	1	20	0	1	So we should take things/ rights away from people because there is a potential they could do criminal things with them?	"Screw ""putting more guns on the street"", how about we give gun owners more rights and more legal opportunities to use them and stop pandering to the criminals."
1.333333333	10098	25798	55	91	1	0	3	3	Their argument is hardly valid, they want to stop the selling of firearms to people because they think it will decrease the crimes and school shootings along with other dangers that are caused by guns.	Exactly how many shootings took place in these settings when students were allowed to not only bring their legally owned guns with them to school, but could also store them in their lockers inside the school?
1	10060	669	82	41	1	21	2	1	If you need guns to ensure that your government doesn't become corrupt or tyranical you wouldn't want them to know where the guns are, would you?	The 2nd Amendment is not there to entitle you to all of the gun control you want!
2.333333333	9330	1078	9	1	1	17	53	1	Gun prohibitionists argue that the Second Amendment confers a right to bear arms only on duly enrolled members of a state militia.	The Second Amendment confers the right to bear arms, and earlier this year a U.S. Supreme Court ruling curtailed government's ability to regulate guns.
2	8035	28080	75	516	1	0	0	3	people who want to kill, will kill if you ban guns, they will kill with knives, or something else.	Even in Japan, the nation with the most absolute strictest gun laws in the world, criminals are still getting their hands on banned guns and killing people with them.
3.666666667	28080	7815	179	14	3	1	3	1	All that I point out is that Canada, which has very strict gun control laws, also has a much lower murder rate than does the USA.	Countries that ban guns or implement stricter laws concerning firearms have lower crime rates.
2	4400	264	10	14	1	2	1	1	And if the ban failed to lower crime rates, why not support less gun control to effectively accomplish this?	All one can reasonably conclude is that more firearms does not increase the homicide rate, nor does less guns reduce it.
4	9841	10057	271	146	1	10	9	1	The Second Amendment isn't about a right to serve in the militia as a government owned slave.	The Second Amendment is about legal and lawful activities, not fulfilling some duty to the government, or serving in the military.
1	9014	10474	52	1	1	1	5	1	If a person does not want to own or carry a gun then so be it, and if an individual does own guns then like wise.	Most gun owners are just ordinary people who happen to own a firearm.
4	1131	1103	88	34	1	2	3	1	Gun control laws do not affect criminals because criminals do not obey these laws.	Criminals will not be stopped from taking guns into gun free zones because criminals do not obey laws!
1.333333333	8660	339	6	63	1	4	24	1	Law abiding citizens are not going to misuse their firearms and those with criminal records are already banned from owning guns.	Once we disarm law abiding citizens, the only armed civilians around will be criminals who would never willingly give up their weapons.
1.333333333	2927	8654	82	38	1	2	3	1	children are people and nukes are arms so people supporting the second amendment support children having nukes	Some passionately assert that the Amendment protects an individual's right to own guns.
1	296	10783	104	47	1	31	1	1	In some states, some guns are just not allowed and it sticks as a law.	In the fifteen years following the passage of Florida's concealed carry law in 1987, over 800,000 permits to carry firearms were issued to people in the state.
1	4469	546	9	187	1	6	14	1	I also say that when people commit a crime with a gun these people need to be punished not the law-abiding citizens!	Some people who want to ban guns try to use simplistic arguments to suggest that murder rates are tied to the number of guns available for criminal misuse; and they suggest more guns = more crime and less guns = less crime.
1	4813	10622	8	121	1	5	2	1	One private individual asking another if they have guns in the home and then offering them a pamphlet on firearms safety if they say yes has nothing at all to do with gun control or the second amendment.	They argue that the second amendment allows the people the power of weapons so that if the government intrudes on their rights they can defend themselves.
2	1168	5818	22	1	1	28	5	1	Many thousands of Guns are stolen and used in GUN CREATED CRIME because most legal gun owners	Machine gns are currently legal (despite an unconstitutional tax that is required to purchase one) and there has NEVER been a single case of a private citizen using a legally owned machine gun to commit a crime.
2.333333333	48	9496	50	61	1	6	1	1	If the Second Amendment doesn't apply to the states then there is no Second Amendment legal protection against state gun laws (which would include any state laws that ban guns in school areas).	It was felt by many (not all) at the time that such weapons were not military weapons and thus did not fall under the protection of the Second Amendment or the right to bear arms in their own state constitutions.
3	185	8035	25	116	1	1	1	1	Are you saying that since all guns have been banned for civilian use in Countries like England, that murders by guns and gun crimes have gone to absolute zero there?	You can not use this as evidence that the reduction in crime is due to the gun ban.
5	1103	1103	30	34	1	4	3	1	Gun control laws do not affect criminals because criminals do not obey these laws.	Gun control laws do not stop criminals from getting guns.

You still have to prove that gun control equals crime control and your admission that it does not is proof that it is about control and dependency on government to protect you when they have no obligation to do so.
2	30649	9394	7	191	3	1	15	1	For that matter, why not arrest people for breaking any gun law, not just those relating to handguns?	People who follow laws, aren't causing problems with the guns they own.
2.666666667	9803	10359	9	2	1	5	2	1	states with higher rates of household firearm ownership had significantly higher homicide victimization rates for children, and for women and men.States With Higher Levels Of Gun Ownership Have Higher Homicide Rates	"You can't just claim ""Country A has more gun control and a lower homicide rate than Country B does"" and leave it at that."
2	9919	8858	1	86	1	26	8	1	The 2nd amendment only protects a states right to own a Militia.	Handguns and assault weapons are explicitly protected by the 2nd Amendment because they are needed to fight against a tyrannical government, but tanks, fighter aircraft, helicopter gunships, and nuclear weapons are not protected for some reason.
1	534	1543	64	80	1	4	10	1	"I keep hearing about assault weapons ""mowing people down"", yet nobody has ever managed to provide me with an example of this."	I support a persons right to own a gun but if people start getting too many freedoms dealing with their weapons then things could get worse.

I haven't seen anyone explain how another gun control law will fight crime, how it'll make anyone safer, how it'll put criminals away longer, etc.
2.333333333	9054	173	1	106	1	5	55	1	We have guns and we still have crime and lots of gun deaths.	Perhaps if other types of firearms were as strictly regulated as machine guns are then we could make some real progress in reducing gun violence and murder.

1	8105	8682	66	11	1	9	3	1	Right now it is against the law for the government to keep a database of gun owners, that that law would have to be changed, and I think you also know this.	I would support any law that target criminals, but I will not support you as long as you target lawfull gun owners.
1	36399	1378	39	18	3	0	3	1	If it was just a gun thing then they could go from internation flights from countries with no guns, but it isn't.	We should protect gun laws because of crazy people who go out of control with them and guns these days are getting more advanced and easier to get
1.666666667	8035	673	47	1	1	1	3	1	Ok, so are the gun haters claiming the police department are giving the guns criminals use for crime back to the criminals?	Gun ownership is a protected right, and the fact that criminals use guns in the commission of crime will never change this fact.

1.333333333	10060	10351	82	11	1	21	1	1	So I think gun control on the magnitude you want would effect it, how could it not?	The 2nd Amendment is not there to entitle you to all of the gun control you want!

Muggings, burglaries, rapes, assault and battery are all examples of violent crimes that don't require a gun.
1	9827	7780	26	112	1	35	1	1	Burglars do not use guns, muggers do not use guns.	Plus, if all firearms are illegal, and if one were to illegally obtain a gun, why not own and use automatic weapons, just like the gangs in England are using?
4	4400	28080	15	536	1	2	0	3	If guns would be made illegal, then only criminals would have them.	It is not the legal gun doing the crime it is the illegaly owned guns, so if you take my guns the criminals have no one to stop them since they have guns we don't.
1.333333333	1145	1029	26	25	1	7	2	1	The anti gun/gun control advocate way at dealing with deaths caused by guns is to limit the right to bear arms.	Even though gun clubs at school are not the problem this anti gun/gun control advocate defends no guns at school.
1	1073	9288	45	7	1	1	2	1	Don't you think most citizens are as able to take care of themselves without a bunch of nanny gun grabbers trying to take their rights and guns away in the face of criminal misuse?	Do you think that a gun-ban in the long run would mean that more criminals get their hands on guns or that less criminals get their hands on guns?
3.666666667	1131	1131	39	47	1	3	5	1	Making a gun free zone does nothing to prevent guns from entering it.	Criminals enter gun free zones with guns to commit crimes against unarmed law-abiding citizens.
1.333333333	7482	4400	18	4	1	9	1	1	Are you sure that it is ENTIRELY illegal to own a firearm, or is it possible to obtain a permit for one?	Only why would you need gun registration if guns were illegal?
1.666666667	8035	28080	59	248	1	4	24	3	there are too many gun deaths and while there will never be a ban in America i find it appalling that so many fight to prevent gun restrictions and background checks.	"However although our constitution needs exceptions (no yelling ""fire"" in a movie theater, and background checks for guns), no rights in the bill of rights should be outright banned."
3.333333333	970	1103	13	34	2	2	3	1	Gun control laws do not affect criminals because criminals do not obey these laws.	The criminal homicides almost always include illegally gotten guns- so that's not relevant either as gun control laws won't change that.

Another large source of guns used in crimes are unlicensed street dealers who either get their guns through illegal transactions with licensed dealers, straw purchases, or from gun thefts.
1	4813	975	8	21	1	5	3	1	Now that said, one has to wonder why people for gun control or anti gun types keep telling people that defend the right to bear arms that they could not win a fight.

1	9009	10003	110	29	1	2	19	1	I really do not care particularly what gun control laws states or cities pass.	Or that the Second Amendment only keeps the federal government from passing new gun control laws?
1	7780	8387	113	15	1	6	1	1	Gun control should be left to the person holding the gun.	Gun control makes criminals lives much easier, because they can keep their guns, while they don't have to deal with armed citizens.

1	8048	673	20	1	1	1	8	1	The only gun control law that is needed is the law that prohibits a person from committing a crime with a gun.	If guns are banned, the only people who will surrender them are those who commit nearly no gun crime at all.

You're the one who has to explain why the US crime rates are so high when other countries manage to have guns and not go nuts.
3.333333333	6116	673	16	1	1	6	8	1	The only gun control law that is needed is the law that prohibits a person from committing a crime with a gun.	For instance I don't think that eliminating gun control is the only answer crime control is also needed.
2	673	10847	1	5	1	8	279	1	But that does not change the fact that the law has made the individual into a prohibited person, so that her gun possession is, in itself, a federal felony.	The only gun control law that is needed is the law that prohibits a person from committing a crime with a gun.
2.333333333	9345	7602	18	112	1	0	34	1	As a gun-owner and/or strong 2nd Amendment advocate, its importance cannot be overstated, and I do believe it has the potential to render a slew of local, state and federal laws null and void.	I think the 2nd Amendment does apply to modern guns.
3.333333333	669	10154	24	1	1	11	266	1	The right to bear arms is protected by the Constitutions of Virginia and of the United States.	It is the right of the people (not of persons) that shall not be infringed, the right stated in the Virginia Constitution to train the body of the people in arms in order to defend the free state.
2	28080	7482	150	18	3	1	9	1	Only why would you need gun registration if guns were illegal?	with regard to the fact that most gun crime is from illegl guns, in that case why not make all guns illegal.
1.333333333	296	1543	40	108	1	9	2	1	Using a shotgun or an AK-47 will get the job done, so I don't see the need to ban assault weapons.	I see you always use gun crime rates as an argument, are you totally uninterested in other types of violent crimes, what happens when all guns are banned and we only have knife crimes?

1.666666667	8099	1145	14	1	1	3	8	1	The gun right people demand that they be allowed to hand out pamphlets defending the right to have guns if the school allowed anti gun/gun control advocates to pass out pamphlets vilifying guns.	You're saying that guns should be allowed into school in order to allow some students (or teachers) to defend themselves if they were attacked.
2.666666667	30649	2417	7	72	3	1	2	1	Which is why the ban is a bit of a poor compromise, they've banned guns for law abiding people but they've not done enough to make sure criminals don't have them.	People who follow laws, aren't causing problems with the guns they own.
1.666666667	25130	20890	38	24	3	2	0	3	If guns are banned, the only people that will be affected will be the people that buy guns for protection from criminals, who get their guns illegally anyway.	...Virtually never are murderers the ordinary, law-abiding people against whom gun bans are aimed.
4	764	623	140	47	1	22	9	1	The only people that obey gun control laws that prevent people from taking guns any where are law abiding people.	Why do people that want what they call reasonable limits on the right to bear arms demand laws that only law abiding citizens will obey?
1	8858	637	247	6	1	13	3	1	Of course if a hate groups such as the gun haters want to ban a right they will claim this!	If so, they need to explain why they would leave some firearms, handguns say, in the hands of the people which are involved in more officer deaths than the ones they recommend banning.
3.333333333	1131	1131	39	28	1	1	1	1	Gun free zones are zones where criminals will have guns because criminals will not obey the laws about gun free zones.	Gun free zones are areas where law-abiding citizens are forbidden to carry guns by law.
2	969	1660	12	25	1	6	1	1	The organized militia is equivalent to the well regulated militia of the second amendment.	Even if today's well-regulated militia were the National Guard, the Second Amendment still protects an individual right to keep and bear arms.
3	9636	37823	128	70	1	59	3	3	How can a people defend themselves from the government, unless they are able to maintain the same weapons as the government has?	The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.
1	560	10057	6	111	1	7	24	1	The crime comes from using the gun (or any other weapon) to violate the rights of others.	You can debate that without guns there would be more deaths to other weapons although you can't debate it would be to the same extent as gun murders and crimes would be.
1	7840	1445	3	29	1	9	2	2	So anybody who has a gun for self protection is now dead because they dont have guns, just the criminals.	That will take the criminals off the street and with them off the street there are no gun control concerns.

3	8636	9463	72	12	1	18	2	1	If this is the case, then gun laws have a provable effect on how 'armed' criminals are - more gun control = less gun-carrying criminals, fact.	Doesn't hold together, though - you have no evidence that criminal arms supply is unaffected by gun control.

1	9014	970	52	24	1	1	1	2	I like guns as much as the normal person does but if guns are abused by people, we need restictions.	Most gun owners are just ordinary people who happen to own a firearm.

2.333333333	28080	6753	57	71	3	2	2	1	You somehow seem to think that getting rid of guns will stop people from killing each other.	sure you can kill with other things, but most homicide weapons are guns.
2.666666667	8182	7991	287	74	1	18	1	1	Surely it would help keep guns from going into illegal circulation if individual guns were registered to owners, and any change of ownership also had to be registered, like we do with cars in the UK.	And that assumes that gun control will have no effect on illegal firearm ownership.
1	9059	37757	27	29	1	13	3	3	If anything, cops will come to where you live to take your guns, seeing as they work for the government.	You have been shown the facts that most criminals get their guns from family members or they steal them, even from cops.
2	7991	9211	10	29	1	7	1	1	First you say no law will ever stop criminals from getting guns but now youre saying that criminals are never gun owners.	Are you saying that the only reason there are criminals armed with guns is because we're not willing to accept gun prohibitions as the answer?
1	8636	36399	60	19	1	6	4	3	"Even ""If criminals keep their guns"",(if we were to confiscate all guns) "" they wont be able to use them."	The legal market for firearms gets killed off in hopes of hindering criminals, and instead the criminals continue buying from the black market, importing them illegally, or making their weapons themselves.
1	17959	1543	1	108	3	15	2	1	Using a shotgun or an AK-47 will get the job done, so I don't see the need to ban assault weapons.	However, I can understand that people can use guns for recreation, hunting and sport.

Even in Japan, the nation with the most absolute strictest gun laws in the world, criminals are still getting their hands on banned guns and killing people with them.
1	9037	9394	222	179	1	102	4	1	Police do not know how many guns are in the state or where they are.	Presumably, the cops knew if there was a gun in the homicide house since they searched it (even if it was not used in the homicide.)
3.333333333	623	1131	45	89	1	35	5	1	You propose to abolish gun free zones, and allow people to carry guns into schools.	Would you want your children to go to a school where everyone was allowed to have a gun?
0.666666667	9175	9681	15	141	3	24	2	1	They do not have the expressed, enumerated power to pass any law regarding guns in the constitution.	The numbers above tend to indicate that fewer gun-related homicides is a direct result of stricter gun control laws.
1	7482	10133	18	10	1	9	6	1	Which gun right laws do you support?The right to ban them?you are as anti-gun as they come.Galileo no offense, because you make no pretense about it.	Only why would you need gun registration if guns were illegal?
4	296	296	102	101	1	2	0	1	Gun control will not work because criminals do not obey gun control laws.	Criminals that do not obey gun control laws will be able to obtain guns and use them on the unarmed law-abiding citizens.
1	8025	651	29	10	1	1	29	1	This is why they are not collective rights like the gun haters	Since they've never done this it's only safe to assume that they hate absolutely any kind of gun and want them all banned outright without exception.
1.333333333	5817	185	7	19	1	7	0	1	Gun haters will stop when the right to bear arms is banned!	"""to keep and bear Arms"" - this would include any gun"
1.333333333	296	185	40	25	1	9	1	1	You can not use this as evidence that the reduction in crime is due to the gun ban.	I see you always use gun crime rates as an argument, are you totally uninterested in other types of violent crimes, what happens when all guns are banned and we only have knife crimes?
1	11028	10098	212	234	1	4	0	1	Which would be worthless because you could just repeal that amendment and then repeal the 2nd.	What it seems like you are claiming is that if the owner would otherwise let you in if you didn't have a gun, you have a right to go in by the 2nd amendment.
2.666666667	25798	6753	63	71	3	29	2	1	You somehow seem to think that getting rid of guns will stop people from killing each other.	Therefore you feel more guns is the solution to stopping gun crime.
2	953	28080	31	190	1	5	3	3	It is just a case of prevention, remove guns being so easily accessible and you then decrease the gun crime and remove the need for guns to defend yourself.	Also if both points are true, would you sacrifice you right to protect your rights with guns (rather than politically) for a crime rate low enough where you don't feel you need a gun for protection?
1.666666667	4400	11417	26	1	1	8	1	3	Some studies used against gun have been ones showing that over 50% of homicides in the US are committed with guns, while in countries with gun bans or very strict gun control have a lower amount of gun homicides.	Gun control in the U.S. does not equal crime control.
1.333333333	1103	38588	46	4	1	6	4	3	I see, so banning guns just stops law abiding citizens from having them, yet your family of criminals buys them from people who legally obtained them, or has them legally obtained for them.	They didn't shoot someone because they were criminals, they because criminals because they shot someone, Your point boils down to 'Laws do not work because people disobey them-we should have no laws'.
3	10145	546	58	101	1	22	3	1	Notice not one of the common sense gun control laws gun hater pilot is demanding is to punish dangerous criminals by keeping them in prison to keep guns away from them!	The gun control mentality that a felon is too dangerous to be allowed to legally buy a gun, yet they're not dangerous enough to take out of the public no matter how heinous a crime they've committed.
1.333333333	9009	10121	36	1	1	2	44	1	Of course, nothing in the text of the Second Amendment places location-based limits on the right to keep and bear arms.	It took the 14th amendment for them to get the right to keep and bear arms and still today the gun grabber agenda is based on denial of rights, all rights and not just Second Amendment rights.
1	48	7840	27	3	1	20	9	1	That will take the criminals off the street and with them off the street there are no gun control concerns.	"Screw ""putting more guns on the street"", how about we give gun owners more rights and more legal opportunities to use them and stop pandering to the criminals."
1	28080	8929	57	71	3	2	16	1	(After having several family members get killed by being shot from those with ILLEGAL guns you realise LEGAL guns aren't the problem)	sure you can kill with other things, but most homicide weapons are guns.
1.666666667	10149	173	6	106	1	3	55	1	We have guns and we still have crime and lots of gun deaths.	Or, to put it another way, more guns = more crime, and if we could stop the illegal gun running then we would have less guns = less crime.
1	28080	25130	31	34	3	3	32	3	One of the reason we are the country we are is because of our right to own guns.	I believe the MAIN reason we should all support the 2nd amendment is to keep the power of gun ownership in our hands and not in the hands of the government.
3.666666667	820	546	22	121	1	11	2	1	Criminals kill people so gun haters like gun hater pilot want to pass gun control laws that only law abiding citizens obey!	All gun control laws do is stop law abiding citizens from having guns!
2.333333333	623	764	7	140	1	2	22	1	Why do people that want what they call reasonable limits on the right to bear arms demand laws that only law abiding citizens will obey?	It is interesting how people that want to ban the right to bear arms never apply their logic to the rights they like.
1	534	673	64	1	1	7	3	1	Ok, so are the gun haters claiming the police department are giving the guns criminals use for crime back to the criminals?	A criminal with a gun will feel a lot more confident in committing a crime than a criminal without a gun will just as a criminal will avoid those who have guns and target those who don't.
2.333333333	546	546	153	96	1	17	2	1	Therefore, we should not allow anyone to carry a gun on a plane, because these people may either be law abiding or not.	I think the government has taken responsibility for the law abiding citizens by ensuring that nobody can carry a gun or other dangerous weapon on board a plane.
1	8048	4469	20	9	1	1	6	1	Some people who want to ban guns try to use simplistic arguments to suggest that murder rates are tied to the number of guns available for criminal misuse; and they suggest more guns = more crime and less guns = less crime.	If guns are banned, the only people who will surrender them are those who commit nearly no gun crime at all.
1	296	534	17	64	1	11	4	1	I support a persons right to own a gun but if people start getting too many freedoms dealing with their weapons then things could get worse.	Now tell me, how is gun control going to stop people from making their own?
2.666666667	10149	9913	6	77	1	3	17	1	Less than 1% of guns wind up in crime situations and crime has dropped with more gun and continues to drop despite agressive prosecution.	Or, to put it another way, more guns = more crime, and if we could stop the illegal gun running then we would have less guns = less crime.
1.333333333	8405	10154	24	1	1	2	124	1	In sum, we hold that the District's ban on handgun possession in the home violates the Second Amendment, as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense.	Gun control' does not mean a ban on all self-defence
1	991	534	5	21	2	0	1	1	I seriously cannot believe that someone out there really thinks that we should allow EVERYBODY to carry weapons onto an airplane!	I don't believe guns are good for anything, and I see no use in having them, but I believe it is everybody's right to produce or keep one, as it is just a weapon like anything else.
3.333333333	975	2280	17	22	1	4	0	2	THE SECOND AMENDMENT- A well regulated militia,being necessary to the security of a free state,the right of the people to keep and bear arms,shall not be infringed.PERIOD.	Please note that the argument is that the reason people shall have the right to keep and bear arms is in order to maintain a well regulated militia.
1	10352	28080	28	574	1	3	0	3	Guns don't kill people, if they did, they would go to jail for murder- not the murderers.	So if its cause people in high crime areas want to buy guns for protection then why do they only want protection against gun murders but not other crimes.
3.666666667	25130	8858	38	86	3	9	8	1	The 2nd amendment only protects a states right to own a Militia.	"In recent years it has been suggested that the Second Amendment protects the ""collective"" right of states to maintain militias, while it does not protect the right of ""the people"" to keep and bear arms."
1	8182	123	74	11	1	3	4	1	Most violent crime with guns occurs at knife fighting range.	If a gun used to commit crimes isn't found in the registry, then the registry isn't much of a valuable crime fighting tool is it?
2.333333333	8092	1073	6	35	3	2	3	1	Although I think a gun-ban should be effective since you can�t eliminate criminality entirely, and it�s the criminals, lunatics and otherwise unbalanced people that you don�t want to have guns or have an easy time getting guns.	now imagine if no criminals could get hold of a gun, you wouldn't need a protection, as no criminals have guns.
1	8035	9270	116	74	1	1	10	1	Sure you say guns don't kill people but people kill people, but the gun is only a tool or a means to that end.	Are you saying that since all guns have been banned for civilian use in Countries like England, that murders by guns and gun crimes have gone to absolute zero there?
4.333333333	10264	10154	66	50	1	2	1	1	We're talking about deadly lethal weapons that are way more powerful than what the authors of the Second Amendment had in mind.	The Founders had in mind guns that were much less powerful when they wrote the Second Amendment.
1.333333333	9096	20890	1	24	1	30	0	3	If guns are banned, the only people that will be affected will be the people that buy guns for protection from criminals, who get their guns illegally anyway.	FACT: Because it is already illegal for convicted felons to own guns, the Fifth Amendment protects felons from being forced to incriminate themselves by registering their guns.
1	9394	764	94	132	1	0	179	1	VoR you keep saying that your for reasonable gun control but yet all your false idols keep chiming in here on a TOTAL gun ban, government confiscation, and allowing elitists to continue to carry.	To generalize gun owners in this way must mean you're either a complete dick or that your government likes to keep you ignorant.
1	4400	9270	262	74	1	10	10	1	Sure you say guns don't kill people but people kill people, but the gun is only a tool or a means to that end.	Also: More people are killed in car accidents than are killed by guns.
2	8105	9054	66	22	1	9	8	1	So if you support every amendment made to the constitution pertaining to guns, than I submit your not to interested in owning a gun.	I would support any law that target criminals, but I will not support you as long as you target lawfull gun owners.
1	7780	28080	161	574	1	4	0	3	Guns don't kill people, if they did, they would go to jail for murder- not the murderers.	That includes populations, gun homicides, non gun homicides and households with weapons in them.
2.666666667	48	9601	4	14	1	2	6	1	All that does is imply that crime rate depends on more than just the presence/absence of guns - it disproves 'more guns = more crime' about as much as it disproves 'more guns = less crime'.	I worry that the reduction of gun ownership will increase crime rates even in households with a gun.
1.666666667	7716	12361	3	66	1	4	3	3	Especially considering the fact that most of the armed services would likely side with gun owners.	Or the belief that the militia is dependant on citizens being able to be armed as they see fit rather than the ownership of firearms being contingent upon militia service?
4.333333333	7967	9037	39	36	1	0	7	1	"The Supreme Court has determined that the Second Amendment is directly linked to personal defense, not anything like hunting, and therefore a ""sporting only"" prerequisite for owning a firearm would never pass constitutional muster."	Well the Supreme Court has specifically stated that the Second Amendment is about self-defense and other lawful purposes, and a sports gun is a poor choice for a self-defense weapon.
4	623	296	94	102	1	27	0	1	Gun control laws will not work because criminals do not obey gun control laws!	Simple if the gun haters did not want your guns why do gun haters only want gun control laws that law abiding citizens obey and criminals do not?
1.333333333	673	49	1	89	1	8	0	1	A gun haters is a person that wants gun control laws that infringe on the right to bear arms or wants to ban the right to bear arms.	The only gun control law that is needed is the law that prohibits a person from committing a crime with a gun.
1.333333333	8105	1211	70	1	1	1	20	1	They note the double standard that allows ''elites'' to carry guns, or have their children protected by armed bodyguards.	I already said children could tote around their parents guns.
1.666666667	10098	10474	104	1	1	39	5	1	If a person does not want to own or carry a gun then so be it, and if an individual does own guns then like wise.	People like Brady blame the gun and say because one man uses a gun to harm someone then no one can be trusted with guns.
3	764	10057	99	146	1	2	9	1	The Second Amendment isn't about a right to serve in the militia as a government owned slave.	Even without this preamble the second amendment would still only protect a right in connection with militia service.
1.333333333	8858	407	51	5	1	13	5	1	Not only will the criminals still have access to guns, but they will also have the added knowledge that either the person they intend to rob does not have a gun or they are breaking the law.	We tell them what was meant when the law passed, but even these gun owners do not care what was meant, they only care what the law says!
1	2417	546	58	245	1	6	18	1	Since civilian marksmanship programs commonly hold civilians to a higher standard than law enforcement officers, would't that mean that in all propreity we should be working to ban cops carrying guns on planes as opposed to law abiding citizens?	We could hypothesize that if guns are banned then law abiding citizens who usually didn't carry or own guns before the ban will be less likely to face armed opponents.
1.333333333	8053	1145	1	66	1	4	2	1	The fact that you like cars is why you will tolerate the fact that more kids are killed by cars then guns.	So if you want to ban guns, 1,531,764 people will get killed or injured, and you'll only take guns out of the hands of those who don't even commit gun crimes.
3	9738	8858	35	188	1	12	8	1	A much higher gun ownership rate than other developed nations could explain this- that although crime occurs less frequently in the US crime is more likely to involve guns in the US so someone is more likely to die.	On average, the states that have done the most to regulate private gun sales appear to have lower firearm death rates and lower firearm homicide rates.
1.666666667	296	764	62	140	1	5	21	1	Why do people that want what they call reasonable limits on the right to bear arms believe criminals will obey a law stating criminals cannot have guns?	People that defend the right to bear arms that demand laws that punish criminals by keeping them in prison thus keeping guns away from them.
2	28080	8777	297	27	3	0	0	1	If we look at D.C. we can see that people who had registered their guns before the gun ban were allowed to keep their guns after the ban took effect.	If today we were to ban guns all the law abiding citizens would give up their firearms and protection.
3.333333333	25130	1131	82	37	3	8	0	1	Gun free zones are areas where law-abiding citizens are forbidden to carry guns.	Gun laws and bans are put in place that only affect good law abiding free citizens.
1.333333333	10273	7997	30	65	1	6	6	1	Do you have anything to offer from King on guns, or for that matter, the 2nd.	You can't be a man unless you're swinging a gun, and no matter how many guns you buy, it's still missing for you .
1	1789	1543	5	92	1	4	4	1	If England wants to ban weapons, that is quite alright, but we should not trade with htem as long as they are violating the human rights of their citizens.	Gun registration schemes have been disabled for criminals because requiring them to register a gun they are forbidden to own would violate their 5th Amendment rights.
4.333333333	1131	1131	37	100	1	1	0	1	Criminals do not obey the laws about gun free zones.	Gun free zones are areas that criminals enter with guns because they know they are no armed law-abiding citizens there to stop them.
1	8004	7964	38	16	1	0	5	1	It is legal to own weapons in this country, they are just tightly controlled, and as a result we have far less gun crime (particularly where it's not related to organised crime).	If guns are more advanced now, then that's all the more reason we should have the right to defend ourselves against them, not less.
2	5818	9820	4	52	1	13	0	1	The only people that're going to get shot are the ones that're trying to either hurt or kill me or my loved ones.	I for one would rather be able to defend my children without the risk of trying to overpower another person to keep the bat from hitting my children.
1	546	9037	101	66	1	3	4	1	So guns kept in a home appear to attract criminals rather than deter them.	Notice not one of the common sense gun control laws gun hater pilot is demanding is to punish dangerous criminals by keeping them in prison to keep guns away from them!
1.666666667	28080	2417	297	58	3	0	6	1	We could hypothesize that if guns are banned then law abiding citizens who usually didn't carry or own guns before the ban will be less likely to face armed opponents.	If today we were to ban guns all the law abiding citizens would give up their firearms and protection.
3.333333333	975	2280	30	22	1	58	0	2	THE SECOND AMENDMENT- A well regulated militia,being necessary to the security of a free state,the right of the people to keep and bear arms,shall not be infringed.PERIOD.	Every person has a right to keep and bear arms for the defense of himself and the state.
2	10910	476	35	15	1	1	2	1	Before the Brady Law any criminal could walk into a gun store and easily purchase a gun.	When a person walks into a gun shop with the expressed idea of buying a gun to kill someone - in a premeditatd act - that - is a problem isn't it.
1.666666667	10098	8543	170	134	1	2	6	1	So unless you're talking about reforming the system, like the NICS Improvement Act was supposed to do, you're obviously talking about denying people their right to own guns in the first place.	Now when you rightfully talk about how the 2nd amendment grants me the right to own a gun people won't take you seriously because you think the 2nd amendment cannot be repealed.
2	9636	10351	31	11	1	2	1	1	So I think gun control on the magnitude you want would effect it, how could it not?	Simply put, you should have to prove that the gun control you seek will do what you say it will do before burdening the Constitution with a load up of Liberal wishes and hopes!
2	4400	28080	206	65	1	3	4	3	I understand that banning guns will not stop criminals from accessing them, but it will surely drop the crime rate and make it much harder to get a gun.	I do see the sense in some measures such as restricting access to guns for people who have committed violent crimes.
3	25130	975	38	30	3	9	58	1	Every person has a right to keep and bear arms for the defense of himself and the state.	"In recent years it has been suggested that the Second Amendment protects the ""collective"" right of states to maintain militias, while it does not protect the right of ""the people"" to keep and bear arms."
1.333333333	28080	8858	472	247	3	2	13	1	If so, they need to explain why they would leave some firearms, handguns say, in the hands of the people which are involved in more officer deaths than the ones they recommend banning.	We didn't ban all guns, just most of them, because our farmers need them and our police need them.
1	10912	10011	3	190	1	1	1	1	"The opposite of ""more guns = less crime is not true"" is not ""more guns = more crime""."	None are so fearful as those who need to have guns and more guns and more guns and more and more ammo, and assault weapons.
1	185	7651	20	130	1	4	4	1	Gun owners don't drive into crowds of people simply because they had a gun in their car.	They will not only confiscate the guns, but then charge the owners of those guns for being terrorists.
1	10056	10474	1	1	1	2	5	1	If a person does not want to own or carry a gun then so be it, and if an individual does own guns then like wise.	So somebody try and tell us, that with stuff like this going on, that America still needs to overhaul its gun laws to bring them more in line with those of Mexico.
2.666666667	28080	2357	297	18	3	0	6	1	Law abiding citizens obey the law, there can surely be no reason to prohibit them form having guns.	If today we were to ban guns all the law abiding citizens would give up their firearms and protection.
3.333333333	2357	2417	18	72	1	6	2	1	Which is why the ban is a bit of a poor compromise, they've banned guns for law abiding people but they've not done enough to make sure criminals don't have them.	Law abiding citizens obey the law, there can surely be no reason to prohibit them form having guns.
2.666666667	7507	8123	21	8	1	3	3	1	If gun control will not affect criminal ownership of guns and people will always be able to get a firearm if they want, why should a government make the effort to ban firearms as a precursor to atrocities?	To inact a law that makes a crime of illegal gun ownership has no effect on criminal ownership of guns.
1	10441	47	12	9	1	12	4	1	"Which passed the law requireing ""smart guns"", if they ever become available (right now they do not exist)."	IF you previously had laws that made openly carrying weapons illegal, and you then pass a concealed carry law, if somebody is carrying a gun and it is not concealed, they are breaking the law.
1.333333333	2158	4786	13	1	1	7	9	1	Even the police forces are saying that the law is pointless as it would only serve to increase the smuggling of handguns from the US, and would likely not have any impact on the rate of handgun use in crimes.	In America, every state that has enacted restrictive gun control has seen an increase in crime, police brutality, questionable law enforcement practices such as violations of 4th amendment rights and so on.
1.333333333	1103	296	46	102	1	6	2	1	Criminals that do not obey gun control laws will be able to obtain guns and use them on the unarmed law-abiding citizens.	They didn't shoot someone because they were criminals, they because criminals because they shot someone, Your point boils down to 'Laws do not work because people disobey them-we should have no laws'.
1	1076	28080	25	581	1	6	6	3	it isn't guns that kill people, is the mentality these people carry around in their heads that kill other people.	"Thus, people do not turn to knives and other potententially lethal weapons less often when more guns are available, but more guns usually means more victims of homicide and suicide."""
1.666666667	10145	9913	24	84	1	1	12	1	You're not allowed to assemble your gun, not even in event of a break in, you're not allowed to load it, or take it from one room of your house to another.	Do you believe,after all you have said demeaning the 2A, Constitution and self-defense, that you should be allowed to purchase and use a gun in times of civil unrest or an attack on your home and family?
2.333333333	970	9827	13	28	2	2	3	1	Name me one gun control law that has been effective as crime control!!!!!!	The criminal homicides almost always include illegally gotten guns- so that's not relevant either as gun control laws won't change that.
1.333333333	10371	123	8	11	1	0	4	1	Most violent crime with guns occurs at knife fighting range.	The argument isn't that guns promote or cause crime, it is that when crimes happen having a gun involved causes more damage.
3	160	1103	8	42	1	7	2	1	I can understand your belief that gun control won't work and that owning guns is a good thing, I don't agree with it, but is hardly beyond comprehension.	Gun Control does not work, well unless you mean by working that crime sky rockets in which case I would have to agree with you and then question your motives as to why you would want it here.
1	7840	651	10	10	1	1	29	1	This is why they are not collective rights like the gun haters	Civilians with other types of gun should be shot on sight by them.
1	7482	8065	18	2	1	9	0	1	First you need to be old enough to be able to legally own a weapon and vote to change laws.	Only why would you need gun registration if guns were illegal?
3.333333333	9738	296	35	4	1	12	2	1	Then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the US?	On average, the states that have done the most to regulate private gun sales appear to have lower firearm death rates and lower firearm homicide rates.
1	7991	1378	10	20	1	7	1	1	Seeing as we are saying would having a gun have stopped the 9/11 attacks you have to assume that you have smuggled one on.	Are you saying that the only reason there are criminals armed with guns is because we're not willing to accept gun prohibitions as the answer?
3.333333333	8660	669	6	39	1	4	0	1	gun control doesent solve anything in fact it makes crime go up because the criminals will always get their guns and your only disarming the law abiding citizens thus making them easy victims from the criminals.	Once we disarm law abiding citizens, the only armed civilians around will be criminals who would never willingly give up their weapons.
2.666666667	9636	975	128	17	1	59	4	1	Please note that the argument is that the reason people shall have the right to keep and bear arms is in order to maintain a well regulated militia.	The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.
3	9738	10330	35	26	1	12	25	1	In short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns.	On average, the states that have done the most to regulate private gun sales appear to have lower firearm death rates and lower firearm homicide rates.
2	623	623	94	126	1	27	3	1	Anybody that wants gun control laws that infringe on the right to bear arms is a gun haters!	Simple if the gun haters did not want your guns why do gun haters only want gun control laws that law abiding citizens obey and criminals do not?
3	764	9820	99	23	1	2	1	1	The Second Amendment isn't a gun control law, it's an individual right, independent from militia service.	Even without this preamble the second amendment would still only protect a right in connection with militia service.
1	8770	28080	18	234	1	2	14	3	Guns don't kill people, people kill people: absolutely true, but guns allow people to kill people with greater efficiency, which is not necessarily a good thing outside of the battlefield.	Innocent people were butchered where no guns were permitted, while nobody is being shot full of holes in the schools where carrying a gun is permitted.
1.666666667	173	10098	78	170	1	17	2	1	Now when you rightfully talk about how the 2nd amendment grants me the right to own a gun people won't take you seriously because you think the 2nd amendment cannot be repealed.	So you have to read the 2nd amendment as a whole.
2.333333333	546	623	101	30	1	3	15	1	The only problem with gun hater pilot�۪s common sense bs is that the dangerous criminals these laws are meant to keep guns away from do not obey gun control laws!	Notice not one of the common sense gun control laws gun hater pilot is demanding is to punish dangerous criminals by keeping them in prison to keep guns away from them!
3.333333333	10011	9601	190	14	1	1	6	1	All that does is imply that crime rate depends on more than just the presence/absence of guns - it disproves 'more guns = more crime' about as much as it disproves 'more guns = less crime'.	"The opposite of ""more guns = less crime is not true"" is not ""more guns = more crime""."
2	173	296	98	62	1	4	2	1	Gun haters think banning guns will make criminals stop being criminals.	Gun haters are like the dangerous criminals the gun haters want to keep guns away from.
2.333333333	623	623	29	126	1	7	3	1	Anybody that wants gun control laws that infringe on the right to bear arms is a gun haters!	But gun hater pilot will demand that the right to bear arms be limited or banned to keep criminals from getting guns.
2	49	674	89	5	1	0	20	1	All of the gun control laws the gun haters want will only be obeyed by the law abiding citizens!	A gun haters is a person that wants gun control laws that infringe on the right to bear arms or wants to ban the right to bear arms.
2.333333333	8636	8858	72	201	1	18	2	1	"This is just further proof that gun control does not equal crime control and there are no ""reasonable"" nor ""responsible"" gun control laws."	Doesn't hold together, though - you have no evidence that criminal arms supply is unaffected by gun control.
4.333333333	25130	25130	82	82	3	13	8	3	Gun laws and bans are put in place that only affect good law abiding free citizens.	where gun control laws prohibit good law abiding citizens from carrying a gun to protect themselves and others.
1.333333333	7987	10461	35	30	1	6	20	1	You would rather be confronted by a guy with a baseball bat because you are FAR more likely to get killed by the guy with the gun.	So now you're saying that just because somebody owns a gun, they're somehow more likely to start killing people than somebody who doesn't own a gun?
1.333333333	296	546	77	187	1	11	14	1	I also say that when people commit a crime with a gun these people need to be punished not the law-abiding citizens!	and who commits crimes, Criminals, so if you take guns away from law abiding citizens insuring that criminals will still be able to get weapons will have more targets to attack because people don't have any defense against criminals.
3.666666667	1145	4400	66	262	1	2	10	1	Also: More people are killed in car accidents than are killed by guns.	The fact that you like cars is why you will tolerate the fact that more kids are killed by cars then guns.
1	1073	10368	6	32	1	0	15	1	Every traffic stop or other law enforcement/citizen encounter in which law enforcement learns that the citizen possesses a firearm would now allow for suspicion that the firearm may have been obtained without going through the background check process.	Is your point that citizens should be allowed to have guns to defend themselves from the government or that citizens should be allowed to have guns to protect themselves from other citizens?
3.666666667	9320	9320	96	98	1	6	6	1	My point was that the theory that more gun control leaves people defenseless does not explain the lower murder rates in other developed nations.	Yes, that must be the reason why in other developed nations where there are more restrictions on guns less defenseless people are being murdered by criminals.
2.666666667	10662	6651	87	7	1	4	46	1	Indeed, the right to keep and bear arms���which we have explained pre-existed, and therefore was preserved by, the Second Amendment���was subject to restrictions at common law.	"In the dicta from a maritime law case the Supreme Court commented that state laws restricting concealed weapons do not infringe upon the right to bear arms protected by the Federal Second Amendment."""
3	8089	8858	15	188	1	9	8	1	A much higher gun ownership rate than other developed nations could explain this- that although crime occurs less frequently in the US crime is more likely to involve guns in the US so someone is more likely to die.	You're the one who has to explain why the US crime rates are so high when other countries manage to have guns and not go nuts.
2.333333333	476	7543	15	30	1	2	0	3	It's pointless people with criminal backgrounds aren't buying guns from gun stores (all of which already run background checks) there are no background checks on the black market and laws won't change that.	Before the Brady Law any criminal could walk into a gun store and easily purchase a gun.
5	296	296	102	101	1	0	0	1	Gun control will not work because criminals do not obey gun control laws.	Gun control laws will not work because criminals do not obey gun control laws!
2.333333333	28080	28080	588	425	3	5	1	3	Do not ban guns when guns are the tools of man.	also, a gun is only dangerous if its used by the wrong person.
2.333333333	4400	8168	356	103	1	10	1	1	And as far as carrying in public, as long as I have commited no crime, then why should anyone need know I have my gun.	My biggest disagreement is that I think one should carry any weapon one decides to.
2.666666667	10149	173	6	106	1	3	54	1	We have more crime than fully armed countries not because we don't have guns.	Or, to put it another way, more guns = more crime, and if we could stop the illegal gun running then we would have less guns = less crime.
1.333333333	2686	8035	5	47	1	1	1	1	Gun ownership is a protected right, and the fact that criminals use guns in the commission of crime will never change this fact.	In England, where currently the private ownership of hand guns by the law abiding is absolutely prohibited, crimes involving the use of guns are rapidly increasing: only the criminals have access to them.
4.666666667	7507	2417	21	65	1	3	1	1	Gun control laws do not deprive gun ownership for those who do not follow laws.	To inact a law that makes a crime of illegal gun ownership has no effect on criminal ownership of guns.
0.666666667	8858	1194	34	3	1	22	14	1	I think laws stating that you should not be allowed to carry guns onto airplanes or into schools are examples of common sense gun control laws meant to protect people.	Also once you become an agent of the government you stop having right, you have authorities and you're controlled by the people the Constitution is supposed to protect you against.
2.666666667	9037	8543	261	117	1	67	10	1	Banning guns will not ban the threat of criminal violence it will just make the law abiding subject to the will and whim of the stronger thugs	If more guns present means that more criminals will be able to commit more killings and violent criminals, wouldn't they have allowed the ban to remain in place?
1.333333333	534	7991	64	8	1	7	4	1	Keeping violent criminals in prison would do far more to reduce gun crime than banning guns.	A criminal with a gun will feel a lot more confident in committing a crime than a criminal without a gun will just as a criminal will avoid those who have guns and target those who don't.
3	1131	1131	37	28	1	0	1	1	Gun free zones are zones where criminals will have guns because criminals will not obey the laws about gun free zones.	Gun free zones are areas where law-abiding citizens are forbidden to carry guns.
3.333333333	30649	623	7	47	3	1	9	1	The only people that obey gun control laws that prevent people from taking guns any where are law abiding people.	People who follow laws, aren't causing problems with the guns they own.
1.666666667	28080	37823	57	93	3	2	112	3	Please tell the murder victims in these other countries that gun control works.	sure you can kill with other things, but most homicide weapons are guns.
1.666666667	669	8858	46	188	1	10	8	1	A much higher gun ownership rate than other developed nations could explain this- that although crime occurs less frequently in the US crime is more likely to involve guns in the US so someone is more likely to die.	The reality is that in developed nations with stricter gun laws than the US there are less outlaws owning and using guns.
1	9054	10011	1	240	1	5	4	1	We have a right to use a gun to defend ourselves and others.	Perhaps if other types of firearms were as strictly regulated as machine guns are then we could make some real progress in reducing gun violence and murder.
2	970	9463	13	12	2	2	2	1	If this is the case, then gun laws have a provable effect on how 'armed' criminals are - more gun control = less gun-carrying criminals, fact.	The criminal homicides almost always include illegally gotten guns- so that's not relevant either as gun control laws won't change that.
2	1194	10229	19	10	1	3	21	1	I'd love to see how gun rationing, ammunition documentation, ending private sales, gun registration, and restriction of right to carry, has helped reduce violence crimes and make things difficult for criminals.	I only support common sense gun control measures, thing such as no guns in schools, no guns on airplanes, background checks for the sale of all firearms, tougher sentences for crimes in which guns are used, etc.
2	10314	8682	12	11	1	12	3	1	Right now it is against the law for the government to keep a database of gun owners, that that law would have to be changed, and I think you also know this.	So to avoid any (more) backlash about the law, Reid included a provision to further protect gun owners from either seeing their insurance rates increase, or from having their names collected and entered into some federal gun owner database.
1	9681	9037	45	234	1	27	1	1	Try as you might, you've done nothing except go on and on and on about how criminals use guns more than honest people, and how having a gun is no guarantee of surviving a violent encounter.	You will go to your grave trying for more and more and even more gun control.
2.333333333	1103	9463	34	12	1	3	2	1	If this is the case, then gun laws have a provable effect on how 'armed' criminals are - more gun control = less gun-carrying criminals, fact.	Gun control laws do not affect criminals because criminals do not obey these laws.
1.666666667	8328	48	46	4	1	10	2	1	I worry that the reduction of gun ownership will increase crime rates even in households with a gun.	Offenses committed with all types of firearms, including air guns, have also increased.
2.333333333	9099	10011	123	190	1	4	1	1	"The opposite of ""more guns = less crime is not true"" is not ""more guns = more crime""."	Rather, if firearms availability does matter, the data consistently show that the way it matters is that more guns equal less violent crime.
3.333333333	7651	10041	63	28	1	3	26	1	Especially since one of your arguments is that the Second Amendment only protects arms suitable for militia duties, which would be all semi-automatic firearms in existence!	First, the ruling was that the Second Amendment only applied to firearms that had a militia purposes and that the sawed-off shotgun in question didn't have any evidence of being suitable for a militia.
2	28080	28080	57	197	3	0	5	3	Reports show that a small percentage of gun owners actually use a gun to defend themselves, there are more killed with a gun, than those using a gun to protect themselves, they cain't say it's used for selfdefense.	all guns are used for is killing, they are weapons.
1	8042	534	6	95	1	15	4	1	If that means gun control then so be it, but it does not.	Less gun control probably means more criminals will have guns, however it also means more civilian lives will be saved.
1.666666667	4400	25798	15	63	1	2	29	3	Therefore you feel more guns is the solution to stopping gun crime.	It is not the legal gun doing the crime it is the illegaly owned guns, so if you take my guns the criminals have no one to stop them since they have guns we don't.
1	9820	8004	69	76	1	2	10	1	You're right that gun control isn't about guns, however, but 'control' is a secondary matter, a means to an end.	"So, no, I wouldn't say there was any ""gun control"" as you (Galileo) tried to pass off as early gun control laws."
3.666666667	674	185	5	19	1	21	0	1	Gun haters will stop when the right to bear arms is banned!	Gun haters are the extremist hate group demanding to ban the right to bear arms!
4.333333333	8636	8330	182	77	1	7	3	1	If the burglar is armed with any deadly weapon (knife, crowbar, gun, etc) then the sentence range is not less than 20 years up to life imprisonment.	In my state, home burglary is a felony punished by a maximum sentence of 1-20 years, unless the burglar is armed with a deadly weapon when he breaks in, which increases the punishment to 20 years to life.
4	28080	296	179	4	3	1	2	1	Then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the US?	Countries that ban guns or implement stricter laws concerning firearms have lower crime rates.
2.333333333	6116	8008	16	22	1	6	10	1	Again, I don't think anybody will argue that owning a gun prevents crime.	For instance I don't think that eliminating gun control is the only answer crime control is also needed.
1.666666667	534	7602	64	15	1	7	1	1	The criminals already have plenty of guns, that means that ending gun ownership will play no real part in ending gun possession by criminals.	A criminal with a gun will feel a lot more confident in committing a crime than a criminal without a gun will just as a criminal will avoid those who have guns and target those who don't.
1.333333333	9820	10003	69	29	1	2	19	1	I really do not care particularly what gun control laws states or cities pass.	"So, no, I wouldn't say there was any ""gun control"" as you (Galileo) tried to pass off as early gun control laws."
2.333333333	8682	6651	43	8	1	9	44	1	The pre-existing right to keep and bear arms was premised on the commonplace assumption that individuals would use them for these private purposes, in addition to whatever militia service they would be obligated to perform for the state.	In addition to ORGANIZING the militia, and while congress has the power to ARM the militia, they have no responsibility to do so, and they have NEVER provided personal weapons.

1.333333333	28080	4400	241	262	3	0	10	1	Also: More people are killed in car accidents than are killed by guns.	Then we should ban so stupid people can't kill people with guns.

If people are smoking themselves to death then that is their business, but if people are murdering each other with guns then there is more reason for government intervention.
3	5376	12361	2	76	1	8	3	3	This should be a clear indicator that legal ownership of guns in no way has increased potential criminality for law abiding citizens.	The higher rate of gun ownership by criminals is far outweighed by the threat of citizens owning guns.
2.333333333	8541	1103	8	25	1	0	0	1	This is just as unrealistic a view that saying gun laws will prevent all crime- of course some criminals will not obey the law- that is what makes them criminals!

1.333333333	4813	1145	8	1	1	5	8	1	The gun right people demand that they be allowed to hand out pamphlets defending the right to have guns if the school allowed anti gun/gun control advocates to pass out pamphlets vilifying guns.

1.666666667	534	8035	64	47	1	7	1	1	Gun ownership is a protected right, and the fact that criminals use guns in the commission of crime will never change this fact.

3	1103	9463	30	12	1	4	2	1	If this is the case, then gun laws have a provable effect on how 'armed' criminals are - more gun control = less gun-carrying criminals, fact.	Gun control laws do not stop criminals from getting guns.
1.333333333	8929	9037	90	234	1	5	1	1	Try as you might, you've done nothing except go on and on and on about how criminals use guns more than honest people, and how having a gun is no guarantee of surviving a violent encounter.

3.333333333	1131	1131	90	28	1	4	1	1	Gun free zones are zones where criminals will have guns because criminals will not obey the laws about gun free zones.	All gun free zones can do, is keep law-abiding citizens from having guns.
1	9919	8654	1	20	1	56	1	1	Machine guns are not in common use so I see no reason to believe restrictions on them would be lifted based on the ruling.	I believe in gun control (and wrote this piece to satirize pro-gunners) because I hate guns and want to see them all banned, which is why I own guns and also enjoy reading firearms-related literature.
1.666666667	28080	2417	215	72	3	0	2	1	Which is why the ban is a bit of a poor compromise, they've banned guns for law abiding people but they've not done enough to make sure criminals don't have them.	Guns are dangerous even though when they are banned people will still make them people think that they will still use them less people will use them less deaths will be by guns.
2.333333333	9100	8543	1	132	1	22	4	1	Well if criminals are getting their guns through licensed dealers, how come these records of sale aren't being used for the purpose of tracking down gang members who obviously bought their guns legally?	Another large source of guns used in crimes are unlicensed street dealers who either get their guns through illegal transactions with licensed dealers, straw purchases, or from gun thefts.
1.666666667	623	9919	47	3	1	9	1	1	The only way to prevent guns from falling in the hands of criminals is by law abiding people buying every gun that is manufactured and thus leaving no guns available for criminals to buy.	The only people that obey gun control laws that prevent people from taking guns any where are law abiding people.
2.333333333	10098	8654	170	44	1	2	28	1	What the Court is saying, at least to me, is that if you can prove the firearm you have has some usefulness for militia service then the 2nd.	Now when you rightfully talk about how the 2nd amendment grants me the right to own a gun people won't take you seriously because you think the 2nd amendment cannot be repealed.

1.666666667	28080	7991	189	8	3	24	4	1	Keeping violent criminals in prison would do far more to reduce gun crime than banning guns.	However criminal organizations can still smuggle weapons and get assault weapons but the ban on weapons could lower the murder rate and hinder organizations from bulking up with annihilating firepower.
1	10622	1660	121	58	1	2	0	1	Speaking of the 14th amendment, there is one scholar that says an individual right to own a gun came with the 14th amendment, not the second amendment.

3	6753	9270	71	74	1	2	10	1	Sure you say guns don't kill people but people kill people, but the gun is only a tool or a means to that end.	You somehow seem to think that getting rid of guns will stop people from killing each other.
1	8543	25130	221	34	1	13	32	3	One of the reason we are the country we are is because of our right to own guns.	We border two countries one of which is quite corrupt, what makes you think that criminals can't get guns.
2.666666667	8003	9998	16	10	1	1	0	1	Let's be honest, it won't result in any more or less gun deaths and even if it resulted in more gun deaths it would be worth having the amendment.	You've accepted the first posit - that less guns will result in less gun killings.
1	11417	10229	19	10	3	22	21	1	I'd love to see how gun rationing, ammunition documentation, ending private sales, gun registration, and restriction of right to carry, has helped reduce violence crimes and make things difficult for criminals.	"Another point that isn't taken in consideration in the stats that I've seen is that guns are used in self-defense but it still goes down as ""gun violence."""
2	185	28080	25	190	1	1	3	3	It is just a case of prevention, remove guns being so easily accessible and you then decrease the gun crime and remove the need for guns to defend yourself.	You can not use this as evidence that the reduction in crime is due to the gun ban.
1	160	2357	8	43	1	7	30	1	If you choose to not be prepared and not own a gun, that is your choice, you do not however have the right to tell me that I may not.	Gun Control does not work, well unless you mean by working that crime sky rockets in which case I would have to agree with you and then question your motives as to why you would want it here.
1.666666667	7991	8711	10	163	1	7	3	1	Even back in the 60's gun owners were saying that if you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns, and gun safety being stressed, and maybe even mandatory for children will produce benefits.	Are you saying that the only reason there are criminals armed with guns is because we're not willing to accept gun prohibitions as the answer?
1	1789	28080	5	457	1	4	1	3	if guns were banned things such like amo&things;used to build guns would be banned to so how could they build their own?????

2	2417	20890	58	15	1	6	0	3	If guns are banned, there will obviously be less guns in circulation.	We could hypothesize that if guns are banned then law abiding citizens who usually didn't carry or own guns before the ban will be less likely to face armed opponents.
2	38588	2357	5	18	3	2	6	1	Law abiding citizens obey the law, there can surely be no reason to prohibit them form having guns.	Criminals don't care about gun bans, so a gun ban only takes guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens.

1	4786	8858	1	188	1	9	8	1	A much higher gun ownership rate than other developed nations could explain this- that although crime occurs less frequently in the US crime is more likely to involve guns in the US so someone is more likely to die.	Even the police forces are saying that the law is pointless as it would only serve to increase the smuggling of handguns from the US, and would likely not have any impact on the rate of handgun use in crimes.
4	623	546	75	121	1	15	2	1	Criminals kill people so gun haters like gun hater pilot want to pass gun control laws that only law abiding citizens obey!	Gun hater pilot's lack of logic is to not allow law abding citizens the right to bear arms, and do nothing to protect the unarmed law abiding citizens.
2.333333333	10145	2927	1	12	1	1	28	1	Unless the second amendment is recognised as an individual right, and given the full protection of law as other rights are, there is nothing to say that a law could not be passed tomorrow banning all weapons in this country.	The Second Amendment, the right to be armed for all legal and lawful reasons, is finally recognized as not just a fundamental right, but an individual right held by the people, not any state or government.
1	6651	10282	7	7	1	68	0	1	But it appears that support for gun control is higher when people are asked about specific gun laws rather than just a general question about stricter gun control.	It is asserted, therefore, that the D.C. gun control laws irrationally prevent only law abiding citizens from owning handguns.

The first part indicates the importance of the militia, the second part illustrates that the people may be part of that well regulated body or not without infringement of their right to keep and bear arms.
3.666666667	11417	296	1	4	3	1	2	1	Then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the US?	Some studies used against gun have been ones showing that over 50% of homicides in the US are committed with guns, while in countries with gun bans or very strict gun control have a lower amount of gun homicides.
2	546	667	101	3	1	3	15	1	Common sense gun control laws the gun haters want will only affect the law abiding citizens, not the criminals.	Notice not one of the common sense gun control laws gun hater pilot is demanding is to punish dangerous criminals by keeping them in prison to keep guns away from them!
4.333333333	296	28080	77	415	1	11	4	3	Something else you must keep in mind is that if we outlaw guns, the only people with guns will be outlaws, this leaves no defense for law abiding citizens.	and who commits crimes, Criminals, so if you take guns away from law abiding citizens insuring that criminals will still be able to get weapons will have more targets to attack because people don't have any defense against criminals.
1.666666667	9580	10199	75	260	1	13	6	1	What you've been doing isn't a debate about gun control, it's criticism of the Supreme Court for saying the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own a gun for legal purposes.	You keep claiming that you're not of the anti-gun camp, that you actually support the Second Amendment.
1	10149	8543	1	197	1	0	9	1	So how is controlling the law-abiding going to help when murder is already illegal, it is already illegal for a convicted criminal to be even in the same room as a gun.	Saw a great article today by Michael Bloomberg (yes, that Michael Bloomberg), about where the illegal guns used in crimes come from - mainly from the states with weak gun control laws.
3	476	623	11	94	1	12	27	1	Simple if the gun haters did not want your guns why do gun haters only want gun control laws that law abiding citizens obey and criminals do not?	The laws the gun haters want will keep the right to bear arms from the law abiding citizens!
1	9681	669	45	41	1	27	2	1	If you need guns to ensure that your government doesn't become corrupt or tyranical you wouldn't want them to know where the guns are, would you?	You will go to your grave trying for more and more and even more gun control.
3.666666667	4400	38588	15	4	1	2	4	3	I see, so banning guns just stops law abiding citizens from having them, yet your family of criminals buys them from people who legally obtained them, or has them legally obtained for them.	It is not the legal gun doing the crime it is the illegaly owned guns, so if you take my guns the criminals have no one to stop them since they have guns we don't.
1	1521	764	1	187	1	16	5	1	I am, however, suprised that gun rights advocates use this case to defend the right to own guns, because the case seems to imply the opposite, as stated by Tim.	This is why I advocate explaining the costs of guns as much as possible, and fighting the gun lobby at every turn.
1	173	673	98	1	1	4	3	1	Ok, so are the gun haters claiming the police department are giving the guns criminals use for crime back to the criminals?	Gun haters are like the dangerous criminals the gun haters want to keep guns away from.
5	10264	10759	66	58	1	2	4	1	Furthermore, the Founders envisioned people being armed with much less powerful weapons when they wrote the Second Amendment.	The Founders had in mind guns that were much less powerful when they wrote the Second Amendment.
1.666666667	6116	10351	16	11	1	6	1	1	So I think gun control on the magnitude you want would effect it, how could it not?	For instance I don't think that eliminating gun control is the only answer crime control is also needed.
2	546	8168	187	103	1	14	1	1	And as far as carrying in public, as long as I have commited no crime, then why should anyone need know I have my gun.	I also say that when people commit a crime with a gun these people need to be punished not the law-abiding citizens!
1	185	9496	26	61	1	9	1	1	If the Second Amendment doesn't apply to the states then there is no Second Amendment legal protection against state gun laws (which would include any state laws that ban guns in school areas).	Since there are gun deaths in countries that have banned guns, the gun bans did not work.
1.333333333	18549	8858	40	247	3	13	13	1	If so, they need to explain why they would leave some firearms, handguns say, in the hands of the people which are involved in more officer deaths than the ones they recommend banning.	I like how anti gun people say we need to protect everyone from the rare gun events by banning guns, but when someone suggests banning the more frequent hammer and club attacks, they can justify those deaths.
1	296	673	62	1	1	2	3	1	Ok, so are the gun haters claiming the police department are giving the guns criminals use for crime back to the criminals?	Gun haters think banning guns will make criminals stop being criminals.
1	9919	9919	5	3	1	1	1	1	The only way to prevent guns from falling in the hands of criminals is by law abiding people buying every gun that is manufactured and thus leaving no guns available for criminals to buy.	The gun industry should be protected against lawsuits because criminal gun dealers who sell firearms to child killers are law abiding, model citizens according to the NRA.
1	9394	4400	179	35	1	4	0	1	I bet all those stranded survivors felt safe in New Orleans without guns knowing the Police was there to protect them.	Police do not know how many guns are in the state or where they are.
3.666666667	7780	669	113	39	1	6	0	1	gun control doesent solve anything in fact it makes crime go up because the criminals will always get their guns and your only disarming the law abiding citizens thus making them easy victims from the criminals.	Gun control makes criminals lives much easier, because they can keep their guns, while they don't have to deal with armed citizens.
2.333333333	8682	8777	11	121	1	3	0	1	I for one do not say that registration of all privately held firearms would violate the constitution.	Right now it is against the law for the government to keep a database of gun owners, that that law would have to be changed, and I think you also know this.
1	28080	25130	443	50	3	0	2	3	So if someone wants to protect themself from a wild animal do they need a gun?	Making guns illegal wouldn't solve anything except to take them away from people that want to defend themselves.
3.666666667	1131	1131	39	100	1	1	0	1	Criminals do not obey the laws about gun free zones.	Gun free zones are areas where law-abiding citizens are forbidden to carry guns by law.
3	6455	25130	22	38	1	6	9	3	"In recent years it has been suggested that the Second Amendment protects the ""collective"" right of states to maintain militias, while it does not protect the right of ""the people"" to keep and bear arms."	The first part indicates the importance of the militia, the second part illustrates that the people may be part of that well regulated body or not without infringement of their right to keep and bear arms.
2.666666667	10547	10149	36	6	1	3	3	1	Or, to put it another way, more guns = more crime, and if we could stop the illegal gun running then we would have less guns = less crime.	And because as he so convincingly puts it : MORE GUNS= LESS CRIME
1.333333333	1115	7929	1	95	1	11	0	1	A law-abiding gun nut who uses their gun in committing a crime, is a criminal, and not law-abiding.	Similarly, a company will still face civil liability in addition to criminal penalties if it has violated state or federal law or sold a gun knowing that it would be used to commit a crime.
2.666666667	10662	953	81	6	1	0	9	1	And I don't think that the second amendment is a good argument against gun control since the federal courts have not recognized gun-control as being offensive to the second amendment.	I think the precedent set by Heller was that the Second Amendment protects an individual right but judges can still do the mental gymnastics to justify the gun control laws they like.
3	1076	8701	1	45	1	52	1	1	"So an article that is entitled ""Gun control doesn't reduce crime, violence, say studies"" is not claiming that gun control is ineffective?"	The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a division of Handgun Control, Inc., disagreed with Lott's findings, as well as the overall assumption that a reduction in the availability of guns in society reduces violent crime.
3	667	623	3	126	1	15	3	1	Anybody that wants gun control laws that infringe on the right to bear arms is a gun haters!	Common sense gun control laws the gun haters want will only affect the law abiding citizens, not the criminals.
3	8858	10237	86	10	1	8	55	1	Amendment protects the right to have an armed militia or to carry arms in the militia, Congress can assume total control over that armed body and grant that control to the President (See Article II section 2).	The 2nd amendment only protects a states right to own a Militia.
1	673	10847	1	5	1	5	279	1	But that does not change the fact that the law has made the individual into a prohibited person, so that her gun possession is, in itself, a federal felony.	The only way the person would get the gun back is if the person was found not guilty.
2	1461	10403	8	408	1	9	3	1	an attempt to undermine the Constitutional rights of gun owners legally to own and operate, KEEP AND BEAR, guns and other weapons of war (arms) that are enshrined in the 2A and now the XIVth Amendment.	If the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, or any of the other rights guaranteed by the Constitution are to be abridged, they must ne done so by legal means, i.e. constitutional amendment.
2.666666667	8182	12361	287	48	1	18	8	3	If most gun crimes are committed by illegal firearm holders then it means that legal ownership of firearms combined with government monitoring can have a positive effect.	And that assumes that gun control will have no effect on illegal firearm ownership.
1.333333333	2357	296	18	102	1	6	2	1	Criminals that do not obey gun control laws will be able to obtain guns and use them on the unarmed law-abiding citizens.	Law abiding citizens obey the law, there can surely be no reason to prohibit them form having guns.
1.666666667	1461	10662	8	351	1	9	38	1	In effect, theyask the Court to hold the right to keep and bear arms as subject to adifferent body of rules for incorporation than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.	If the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, or any of the other rights guaranteed by the Constitution are to be abridged, they must ne done so by legal means, i.e. constitutional amendment.
1	991	11417	5	19	2	0	22	3	"Another point that isn't taken in consideration in the stats that I've seen is that guns are used in self-defense but it still goes down as ""gun violence."""	I don't believe guns are good for anything, and I see no use in having them, but I believe it is everybody's right to produce or keep one, as it is just a weapon like anything else.
1	1103	1543	42	108	1	2	2	1	Using a shotgun or an AK-47 will get the job done, so I don't see the need to ban assault weapons.	I can understand your belief that gun control won't work and that owning guns is a good thing, I don't agree with it, but is hardly beyond comprehension.
4.666666667	764	764	140	140	1	21	22	1	Why do people that want what they call reasonable limits on the right to bear arms demand laws that only law abiding citizens will obey?	Why do people that want what they call reasonable limits on the right to bear arms believe criminals will obey a law stating criminals cannot have guns?
1.333333333	975	657	21	46	1	3	10	1	Simple if gun haters want people defending the right to bear arms to be in militias, why would you want the militias to have lesser weapons then the enemies they are defending against?	Now that said, one has to wonder why people for gun control or anti gun types keep telling people that defend the right to bear arms that they could not win a fight.
2.333333333	669	11417	46	1	1	10	1	3	Some studies used against gun have been ones showing that over 50% of homicides in the US are committed with guns, while in countries with gun bans or very strict gun control have a lower amount of gun homicides.	The reality is that in developed nations with stricter gun laws than the US there are less outlaws owning and using guns.
1	10265	10003	79	29	1	9	19	1	I really do not care particularly what gun control laws states or cities pass.	We already have more than enough gun Laws and Although I haven't personally checked the statistics I would be willing to bet that most of these Laws that were passed haven't made a big difference in stopping crimes.
1.666666667	546	1103	101	25	1	3	0	1	This is just as unrealistic a view that saying gun laws will prevent all crime- of course some criminals will not obey the law- that is what makes them criminals!	Notice not one of the common sense gun control laws gun hater pilot is demanding is to punish dangerous criminals by keeping them in prison to keep guns away from them!
1	8978	296	14	40	1	16	9	1	I see you always use gun crime rates as an argument, are you totally uninterested in other types of violent crimes, what happens when all guns are banned and we only have knife crimes?	Can you show me any proof that the 50% you refer to actually have or did buy guns before committing a crime?
1	9681	37757	45	29	1	27	3	3	If anything, cops will come to where you live to take your guns, seeing as they work for the government.	You will go to your grave trying for more and more and even more gun control.
1	9054	25130	1	16	1	5	5	3	You didn't address that since we have started adding more and more gun control that violent crimes have gone up and how even though America is #1 in gun ownership it tanks only 107th in homicide rates.	Perhaps if other types of firearms were as strictly regulated as machine guns are then we could make some real progress in reducing gun violence and murder.
2	7964	173	16	106	1	5	54	1	We have more crime than fully armed countries not because we don't have guns.	It is legal to own weapons in this country, they are just tightly controlled, and as a result we have far less gun crime (particularly where it's not related to organised crime).
3.333333333	623	667	94	3	1	27	15	1	Common sense gun control laws the gun haters want will only affect the law abiding citizens, not the criminals.	Simple if the gun haters did not want your guns why do gun haters only want gun control laws that law abiding citizens obey and criminals do not?
2	28080	12361	150	48	3	1	8	3	If most gun crimes are committed by illegal firearm holders then it means that legal ownership of firearms combined with government monitoring can have a positive effect.	with regard to the fact that most gun crime is from illegl guns, in that case why not make all guns illegal.
1.666666667	173	8858	88	133	1	3	2	1	Somebody even made the argument that the definition of arms in the Second Amendment was limited to 18th century flintlocks only, so no modern guns were protected, and the court rejected this argument as well.	Since that ruling most lower federal courts have continued to reject the argument that the second amendment protects an indivual right to own a gun.
2.666666667	9009	9496	110	61	1	2	1	1	If the Second Amendment doesn't apply to the states then there is no Second Amendment legal protection against state gun laws (which would include any state laws that ban guns in school areas).	Or that the Second Amendment only keeps the federal government from passing new gun control laws?
1.666666667	10057	1543	111	47	1	24	0	1	Using illogic, skewed statistics, revisionist history all in an attempt to violate my constitutional rights, that would be you and other gun grabbers who are trying to infringe on law abiding citizens rights.	The crime comes from using the gun (or any other weapon) to violate the rights of others.
2.666666667	4400	10371	44	8	1	15	0	1	The argument isn't that guns promote or cause crime, it is that when crimes happen having a gun involved causes more damage.	If you cannot demonstrate that more citizens owning guns leads to more violent crime, if the stats in fact support the opposite, what reason is there to ban guns?
1.333333333	1076	560	37	6	1	6	7	1	You can debate that without guns there would be more deaths to other weapons although you can't debate it would be to the same extent as gun murders and crimes would be.	It also give the right to equipment with which you could execute murders, armed robberies and other violent crime.
2	10922	12892	1	1	1	16	0	3	Well, owning handguns for personal home protection is different that carrying guns in a concealed fashion for protection.	Since 1980, forty-four states have passed some form of law that allows gun owners to carry concealed weapons outside their homes for personal protection.
2	8089	37823	15	93	1	9	112	3	Please tell the murder victims in these other countries that gun control works.	You're the one who has to explain why the US crime rates are so high when other countries manage to have guns and not go nuts.
2.333333333	1461	9496	29	61	1	23	1	1	If the Second Amendment doesn't apply to the states then there is no Second Amendment legal protection against state gun laws (which would include any state laws that ban guns in school areas).	"Obviously, using the second amendment to oppose laws regulating such weapons is highly questionably."""
2	7840	12361	37	77	1	4	1	3	Law abiding citizens are not criminals, therefore, they have no reason to use these weapons unless for self defense of oneself or others.	This appeared to me to be an argument that self defense cannot exist if a gun is used.
2	28080	9805	347	1	3	2	0	1	Firearms deaths fall as millions obtain permits to carry concealed guns	Then compare it to areas with less gun control laws, such as Texas and Arizona (where concealed carry permits are fairly easy to obtain).
2.333333333	546	2686	215	14	1	1	5	1	Aren't you the one who used to complain that airlines can't choose to allow private citizens to carry guns on planes because of government regulations?	As far as guns, it is difficult to say because currently as in the past, you are not allowed to carry a gun on board an aircraft.
3.666666667	1660	8478	29	31	1	16	3	1	The Miller Court said that the declaration and guarantee of the Second Amendment should be read with the militia end in view.	In other words the Miller case interpreted the Second Amendment to mean one has the right to own militia type weapons.

We should protect gun laws because of crazy people who go out of control with them and guns these days are getting more advanced and easier to get
1.333333333	30649	546	7	192	3	1	13	1	Criminals and terrorist are going to have all the guns they want no matter how many security measures enacted to disarm the law-abiding citizen by people such as you.	People who follow laws, aren't causing problems with the guns they own.
1.333333333	11028	9037	370	261	1	10	67	1	If more guns present means that more criminals will be able to commit more killings and violent criminals, wouldn't they have allowed the ban to remain in place?	They explain why assault weapons are favored by terrorists, mass killers, and violent criminals, and they distinguish such weapons from true hunting and target guns.
3	7543	7543	6	30	3	0	0	3	It's pointless people with criminal backgrounds aren't buying guns from gun stores (all of which already run background checks) there are no background checks on the black market and laws won't change that.	No it's federal law that you have to run background checks in order to keep your FFL (federal firearms license) which allows you to legally sell guns.
1	7651	28080	140	24	1	2	33	3	Knives are used almost as often if not more so in crimes than are guns, the reason nobody is pushing to ban knives is because knives don't have the same negative cultural association guns have.	A gun ban would make guns on the same level as drugs....
1	7929	7780	95	112	1	0	1	1	Burglars do not use guns, muggers do not use guns.	A law-abiding gun nut who uses their gun in committing a crime, is a criminal, and not law-abiding.
2.333333333	9463	9463	12	12	1	4	2	1	If this is the case, then gun laws have a provable effect on how 'armed' criminals are - more gun control = less gun-carrying criminals, fact.	If this is the case then gun control laws will have no effect on who carries melee weapons, so you argument falls apart because 'the law abiding' can remain armed.
1	4469	10352	9	28	1	6	3	1	So if its cause people in high crime areas want to buy guns for protection then why do they only want protection against gun murders but not other crimes.	Some people who want to ban guns try to use simplistic arguments to suggest that murder rates are tied to the number of guns available for criminal misuse; and they suggest more guns = more crime and less guns = less crime.
1	173	546	106	187	1	48	14	1	I also say that when people commit a crime with a gun these people need to be punished not the law-abiding citizens!	In my view I think that complete gun control helps solve a major problem in crime and it would allow people to feel safer because they wouldn't need to have a gun to protect themselves.
1	296	4813	17	3	1	11	2	1	I think a better debate would be when should gun control start?	Now tell me, how is gun control going to stop people from making their own?
2.666666667	2927	12892	44	1	1	13	0	3	Well, owning handguns for personal home protection is different that carrying guns in a concealed fashion for protection.	It dealt with an individual right and further indentified the limits of that right to be certain that the RKBA provision would not be construed to protect the carrying of concealed weapons.
1.666666667	10149	20890	6	15	1	3	0	3	If guns are banned, there will obviously be less guns in circulation.	Or, to put it another way, more guns = more crime, and if we could stop the illegal gun running then we would have less guns = less crime.
2.666666667	9054	10662	19	365	1	12	18	1	An interesting question will be how the court views the registration requirements when a felon gets caught with an ���unregistered�۝ firearm.	The courts up to the supreme court have held that criminals can't be made to register guns.
1	296	8777	17	27	1	11	0	1	If we look at D.C. we can see that people who had registered their guns before the gun ban were allowed to keep their guns after the ban took effect.	Now tell me, how is gun control going to stop people from making their own?
2	10352	7507	38	32	1	12	1	1	It shows a % of the homicides that were committed with guns, but nowhere is there an indication of gun ownership.	That said, the idea that non gun homicides dont increase does not show causation between high gun ownership and increased murder rates.
2.666666667	8089	296	15	4	1	9	2	1	Then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the US?	You're the one who has to explain why the US crime rates are so high when other countries manage to have guns and not go nuts.
4.666666667	296	30649	102	7	1	0	0	3	Gun control laws only control the guns in the hands of people who follow laws.	Gun control laws will not work because criminals do not obey gun control laws!
1.666666667	8284	5376	44	1	1	3	4	1	I think we recognize that gun control laws can reduce the number of criminals owning guns although not disarm every criminal.	I could easily point out how many people are killed by criminals because they aren't armed and able to fight back, and that could be seen as grounds for removing the restrictive gun laws we have in this country.
3	4400	975	390	17	1	3	4	1	Please note that the argument is that the reason people shall have the right to keep and bear arms is in order to maintain a well regulated militia.

1	1073	2686	6	14	1	0	5	1	Aren't you the one who used to complain that airlines can't choose to allow private citizens to carry guns on planes because of government regulations?

1.666666667	2725	9841	13	34	1	15	13	1	Amendment protects the right of the states to arm their militias.	Thus the federal government had no power to correct these violations, rather the citizens had to rely on the police power of the states for their protection from private individuals.

3	9099	9601	123	14	1	4	6	1	All that does is imply that crime rate depends on more than just the presence/absence of guns - it disproves 'more guns = more crime' about as much as it disproves 'more guns = less crime'.	Rather, if firearms availability does matter, the data consistently show that the way it matters is that more guns equal less violent crime.

Which is why the ban is a bit of a poor compromise, they've banned guns for law abiding people but they've not done enough to make sure criminals don't have them.
1	8858	9681	51	141	1	13	2	1	They do not have the expressed, enumerated power to pass any law regarding guns in the constitution.	We tell them what was meant when the law passed, but even these gun owners do not care what was meant, they only care what the law says!

So how is controlling the law-abiding going to help when murder is already illegal, it is already illegal for a convicted criminal to be even in the same room as a gun.
1	657	8004	65	76	1	1	10	1	You're right that gun control isn't about guns, however, but 'control' is a secondary matter, a means to an end.	Now if you want gun control laws that limit or ban the right to bear arms you are a gun haters.
1	6125	173	12	106	1	6	54	1	We have more crime than fully armed countries not because we don't have guns.	I have some experience in dealing with violent crime, and in my opinion we do not have a gun violence problem in America, we have a violence problem in general.
1.666666667	6455	9357	59	14	1	13	6	1	The fact that governments around the world have killed their own citizens after disarming them does not mean that they should not be armed, it means that the citizens should not be disarmed.	Whenever government mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order to raise an army upon their ruins.
3.333333333	185	4469	25	9	1	1	6	1	Some people who want to ban guns try to use simplistic arguments to suggest that murder rates are tied to the number of guns available for criminal misuse; and they suggest more guns = more crime and less guns = less crime.	You can not use this as evidence that the reduction in crime is due to the gun ban.
1.333333333	4400	296	206	40	1	3	9	1	I see you always use gun crime rates as an argument, are you totally uninterested in other types of violent crimes, what happens when all guns are banned and we only have knife crimes?	I do see the sense in some measures such as restricting access to guns for people who have committed violent crimes.
3.666666667	674	637	5	6	1	21	3	1	Of course if a hate groups such as the gun haters want to ban a right they will claim this!	Gun haters are the extremist hate group demanding to ban the right to bear arms!
3	546	623	121	47	1	2	9	1	The only people that obey gun control laws that prevent people from taking guns any where are law abiding people.	Criminals kill people so gun haters like gun hater pilot want to pass gun control laws that only law abiding citizens obey!
1	8035	8342	116	19	1	1	16	1	Are you saying that trying to avoid being murdered isn't a good enough reason for owning or using a gun?	Are you saying that since all guns have been banned for civilian use in Countries like England, that murders by guns and gun crimes have gone to absolute zero there?

1	12361	10371	48	8	3	8	0	1	The argument isn't that guns promote or cause crime, it is that when crimes happen having a gun involved causes more damage.	If most gun crimes are committed by illegal firearm holders then it means that legal ownership of firearms combined with government monitoring can have a positive effect.
2.333333333	12361	2046	48	4	3	8	2	1	In most studies legal purchases of firearms have no influence on the crime rate.	If most gun crimes are committed by illegal firearm holders then it means that legal ownership of firearms combined with government monitoring can have a positive effect.

If more guns present means that more criminals will be able to commit more killings and violent criminals, wouldn't they have allowed the ban to remain in place?

2.333333333	25130	560	34	6	3	15	7	1	You can debate that without guns there would be more deaths to other weapons although you can't debate it would be to the same extent as gun murders and crimes would be.	However, even though there were less deaths, there was a surge in gun crime, death and non-death related, after the ban on guns.
1.666666667	36399	8284	39	44	3	0	3	1	I could easily point out how many people are killed by criminals because they aren't armed and able to fight back, and that could be seen as grounds for removing the restrictive gun laws we have in this country.	We should protect gun laws because of crazy people who go out of control with them and guns these days are getting more advanced and easier to get
1	8875	10133	8	10	1	3	6	1	Which gun right laws do you support?The right to ban them?you are as anti-gun as they come.Galileo no offense, because you make no pretense about it.

4	1131	1131	39	88	1	3	2	1	Criminals will not be stopped from taking guns into gun free zones because criminals do not obey laws!	Criminals enter gun free zones with guns to commit crimes against unarmed law-abiding citizens.
1	28080	7780	40	112	3	4	1	1	Burglars do not use guns, muggers do not use guns.	Gun ban = No civilians can protect themselves using a firearm = Criminals can illegally purchase guns, like tons already do.

I'd love to know what firearms are made and sold but have no constitutional protection for ownership.
3	8008	25798	22	63	1	10	29	3	Therefore you feel more guns is the solution to stopping gun crime.	Again, I don't think anybody will argue that owning a gun prevents crime.
1.333333333	296	7780	62	113	1	5	6	1	Gun control makes criminals lives much easier, because they can keep their guns, while they don't have to deal with armed citizens.	People that defend the right to bear arms that demand laws that punish criminals by keeping them in prison thus keeping guns away from them.
1.333333333	185	7507	26	8	1	9	1	1	I think it is interesting that gun nuts always claim that when guns are banned people will just use knives instead, yet we find that with guns prohibited there are still only 200 deaths a year from knife like weapons.	Since there are gun deaths in countries that have banned guns, the gun bans did not work.
2	8053	9037	40	218	1	9	53	1	If guns really provided this kind of protection, we could easily imagine that one of the previous nine murder attempts would have been successful, had the victim not possessed a gun.	We measured firearm protection as an attempted or completed crime in which the victim reported using a gun to attack or threaten an offender.
2.333333333	969	1103	12	25	1	22	0	1	This is just as unrealistic a view that saying gun laws will prevent all crime- of course some criminals will not obey the law- that is what makes them criminals!

2.666666667	2280	48	1	50	2	0	6	1	It was felt by many (not all) at the time that such weapons were not military weapons and thus did not fall under the protection of the Second Amendment or the right to bear arms in their own state constitutions.

1.666666667	179	534	4	21	1	0	1	1	I seriously cannot believe that someone out there really thinks that we should allow EVERYBODY to carry weapons onto an airplane!	I think law abiding citizens should be allowed to carry conceled weapons.
1	10057	10572	111	29	1	24	6	1	However none of these exceptions would apply to a criminal obtaining a specific firearm through the black market or outright theft, and then going on a shooting spree where others are killed or otherwise maimed.	The crime comes from using the gun (or any other weapon) to violate the rights of others.
1	623	534	30	95	1	15	4	1	If that means gun control then so be it, but it does not.	The only problem with gun hater pilot�۪s common sense bs is that the dangerous criminals these laws are meant to keep guns away from do not obey gun control laws!
1.333333333	8035	28080	47	40	1	1	4	3	Gun ban = No civilians can protect themselves using a firearm = Criminals can illegally purchase guns, like tons already do.	Gun ownership is a protected right, and the fact that criminals use guns in the commission of crime will never change this fact.
2.666666667	8543	6729	197	36	1	9	4	1	Therefore, while most people are hindranced by the laws, criminals will still obtain weapons illegally.	So how is controlling the law-abiding going to help when murder is already illegal, it is already illegal for a convicted criminal to be even in the same room as a gun.
3	764	7482	140	7	1	22	21	1	That most people can't be trusted, so we should have more laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.	Why do people that want what they call reasonable limits on the right to bear arms demand laws that only law abiding citizens will obey?
1	296	975	17	21	1	11	3	1	Now that said, one has to wonder why people for gun control or anti gun types keep telling people that defend the right to bear arms that they could not win a fight.	Now tell me, how is gun control going to stop people from making their own?
3.666666667	4012	969	2	11	1	28	17	1	2) ensure that the right to keep and bear arms for a militia is not infringed.	(or, for those who favor the alternative collective right view, ���the right of militia members to keep and bear their militia arms when called for by the state for militia service?�۝)
3.333333333	10395	6753	11	78	1	5	3	1	Canada, Switzerland, Finland and scores of other countries allow for legal gun ownership but don't have a higher number of gun deaths than countries where guns are illegal.	Various groups have been unable to show that the criminal use of firearms leads to more deaths than the number of lives that are saved by private and legal gun ownership.
4	38588	28080	5	415	3	2	4	3	Something else you must keep in mind is that if we outlaw guns, the only people with guns will be outlaws, this leaves no defense for law abiding citizens.	Criminals don't care about gun bans, so a gun ban only takes guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens.
4	2967	1660	22	64	1	3	10	1	The language and historical intent of the Second Amendment mandates recognition of the individual right to keep and bear firearms and other personal weapons.	I believe that some of my gun control friends know in their hearts they are unable to debunk the overwhelming historical evidence which proves the Second Amendment was intended to recognize an individual right.
1.333333333	9037	9850	261	40	1	3	0	1	I was using it simply to illustrate society's right to be protected from someone commiting the same crime again before they can be prosecuted for the first offence.	I'm more concerned with the concept of why the individual that committed the murder was able to kill in the first place.
2.666666667	28080	764	31	122	3	3	20	1	We may therefore conclude that, any reason or purpose for an individual owning a gun, OTHER THAN for a militia, is not provided for under the 2nd Amendment, and that current gun laws for private ownership of guns is mistaken.	I believe the MAIN reason we should all support the 2nd amendment is to keep the power of gun ownership in our hands and not in the hands of the government.
4	1131	1131	28	42	1	1	1	1	Unarmed law-abiding citizens are victims of gun crimes because criminals do not obey the gun ban in that gun free zone.	Gun free zones are zones where criminals will have guns because criminals will not obey the laws about gun free zones.
3	8048	8123	20	8	1	1	3	1	If gun control will not affect criminal ownership of guns and people will always be able to get a firearm if they want, why should a government make the effort to ban firearms as a precursor to atrocities?	If guns are banned, the only people who will surrender them are those who commit nearly no gun crime at all.
4.666666667	10057	10060	57	98	1	1	8	1	First the argument was that the Second Amendment was a collective right reserved for the sole purpose of guaranteeing states the ability to have private militias.	First you argued that the Second Amendment was a collective rights tool designed to ensure that each state had its own private militia.
4.666666667	820	674	22	5	1	11	20	1	All of the gun control laws the gun haters want will only be obeyed by the law abiding citizens!	All gun control laws do is stop law abiding citizens from having guns!

1	907	9955	4	64	1	0	2	1	As said,I think the people of the USA are quite capable of deciding about their own gun laws without a Brit getting involved but to make guns freely available to British citizens would be a bad, bad idea.	I think what is also important is that nobody to my knowledge is saying that a law abiding citizen shouldn't have the right to own a gun.
3.666666667	28080	25130	297	82	3	0	8	3	Gun laws and bans are put in place that only affect good law abiding free citizens.	If today we were to ban guns all the law abiding citizens would give up their firearms and protection.

2	970	8858	13	201	2	2	2	1	"This is just further proof that gun control does not equal crime control and there are no ""reasonable"" nor ""responsible"" gun control laws."	The criminal homicides almost always include illegally gotten guns- so that's not relevant either as gun control laws won't change that.

1.333333333	476	9919	15	3	1	2	1	1	The only way to prevent guns from falling in the hands of criminals is by law abiding people buying every gun that is manufactured and thus leaving no guns available for criminals to buy.	Before the Brady Law any criminal could walk into a gun store and easily purchase a gun.
1	10154	9841	35	158	1	10	1	1	That's still pretty outrageous to claim, especially given you keep saying only 44 States prohibit the restriction of guns.

If this is the case then gun control laws will have no effect on who carries melee weapons, so you argument falls apart because 'the law abiding' can remain armed.
1.666666667	7840	28080	37	197	1	4	5	3	Reports show that a small percentage of gun owners actually use a gun to defend themselves, there are more killed with a gun, than those using a gun to protect themselves, they cain't say it's used for selfdefense.	This appeared to me to be an argument that self defense cannot exist if a gun is used.
2.666666667	185	674	26	5	1	17	21	1	Gun haters are the extremist hate group demanding to ban the right to bear arms!	Gun haters if the 2nd amend did not protect the right to bear arms then all guns in America would be banned.
1.666666667	20890	9919	24	3	3	0	1	1	The only way to prevent guns from falling in the hands of criminals is by law abiding people buying every gun that is manufactured and thus leaving no guns available for criminals to buy.	If guns are banned, the only people that will be affected will be the people that buy guns for protection from criminals, who get their guns illegally anyway.
2.333333333	5376	9095	2	1	1	8	11	1	Within the United States, rural areas have higher rates of gun ownership and lower rates of murder, whites have higher rates of gun ownership than blacks and much lower murder rates.	The higher rate of gun ownership by criminals is far outweighed by the threat of citizens owning guns.

In order to have a 'well regulated' militia you can not bar the civilian populace of its right to keep and bear arms!
1	10057	10487	66	2	1	3	2	1	Gun traces are requested for any gun that's in police custody for any reason.	Who's going to file a lawsuit and allege that a person doesn't have a right to own a gun for any reason?
2.666666667	623	6651	75	7	1	15	68	1	It is asserted, therefore, that the D.C. gun control laws irrationally prevent only law abiding citizens from owning handguns.	Gun hater pilot's lack of logic is to not allow law abding citizens the right to bear arms, and do nothing to protect the unarmed law abiding citizens.
2.333333333	4400	48	10	4	1	2	2	1	I worry that the reduction of gun ownership will increase crime rates even in households with a gun.	All one can reasonably conclude is that more firearms does not increase the homicide rate, nor does less guns reduce it.
1	10735	28080	67	425	1	12	1	3	Do not ban guns when guns are the tools of man.	One such person who is prohibited by federal law from having a firearm at all is the convicted felon:

2.666666667	9979	975	47	30	1	2	58	1	Every person has a right to keep and bear arms for the defense of himself and the state.	Any further laws on the right to keep and bear arms by State, municipal or any other government is out the window.
2	8636	8977	101	15	1	18	22	1	And several states have recently passed laws allowing gun owners to carry firearms in more places ��� bars, restaurants, cars and parks.	Earlier this decade, the NRA persuaded virtually every legislature in the country to permit gun owners to carry concealed firearms ��� only Illinois and Wisconsin still completely forbid concealed guns.
3.333333333	10003	10713	22	8	1	1	11	1	If the right to keep and bear arms applies within a privately owned structure designated as a dwelling then it must apply outside as well.	They're claiming the right to keep and bear arms applies only to a person's house, not the rest of their property, like the front yard, back yard, porch or garage.
1.333333333	8099	1378	14	20	1	3	1	1	Seeing as we are saying would having a gun have stopped the 9/11 attacks you have to assume that you have smuggled one on.	You're saying that guns should be allowed into school in order to allow some students (or teachers) to defend themselves if they were attacked.
2.333333333	10149	7964	6	16	1	3	5	1	It is legal to own weapons in this country, they are just tightly controlled, and as a result we have far less gun crime (particularly where it's not related to organised crime).	Or, to put it another way, more guns = more crime, and if we could stop the illegal gun running then we would have less guns = less crime.
2	9100	8414	1	3	1	25	2	1	As I think some people who wuv their guns would just XXXX the ignorant politician away with their newly illegal gun.	While many guns are taken off the street when people are arrested and any firearms in their possession are confiscated, a new study shows how easily arrestees believe they could illegally acquire another firearm.
3	8711	10817	58	38	1	8	13	1	There is nothing unclear about the restrictive clause of the 2nd Amendment nor is there any ambiguity that no power was ever granted to the federal government to have any interest whatsoever in the personal arms of the private citizen.	Something that the 2nd amendment told the Federal Government that was not to be infringed.
2.333333333	623	1073	75	6	1	15	0	1	Is your point that citizens should be allowed to have guns to defend themselves from the government or that citizens should be allowed to have guns to protect themselves from other citizens?	Gun hater pilot's lack of logic is to not allow law abding citizens the right to bear arms, and do nothing to protect the unarmed law abiding citizens.

1	9919	7780	5	112	1	16	1	1	Burglars do not use guns, muggers do not use guns.	Criminals will always find ways to get around gun laws which is why there are a lot less criminals who own and use guns in places like the UK and Australia.
1.666666667	10011	10351	173	11	1	4	1	1	So I think gun control on the magnitude you want would effect it, how could it not?	You are pulling the same XXXX Doc did in thinking that because I don't think more guns equals less crime that I automatically must think it means MORE crime and that gun control laws are effective and needed.
3	9270	1076	73	1	1	3	52	1	The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a division of Handgun Control, Inc., disagreed with Lott's findings, as well as the overall assumption that a reduction in the availability of guns in society reduces violent crime.	The theory is that reducing the overall number of handguns will somehow reduce gun crime, which is a little like saying that reducing the overall number of cars will reduce drunk driving.
2.333333333	7991	8182	8	131	1	4	0	1	Supporting gun control to stop violent criminals, is like supporting a ban on cameras to stop child pornography.	Keeping violent criminals in prison would do far more to reduce gun crime than banning guns.
4	28080	20890	40	24	3	4	0	3	If guns are banned, the only people that will be affected will be the people that buy guns for protection from criminals, who get their guns illegally anyway.

0.333333333	10368	10908	27	89	1	3	1	1	The first thing you need to do when someone is charged with a crime is understand what the charge is and what must be proved.	Second, the only reason that you would bother notifying the police is if you think there is some possibility that the person will be charged with trying to illegally obtain a gun.
0.666666667	8035	10199	47	1	1	1	79	1	This broader definition is used to cover general crimes committed with firearms (like possession by felons, armed career criminal violations, etc.)	Gun ownership is a protected right, and the fact that criminals use guns in the commission of crime will never change this fact.
1.333333333	975	49	21	2	1	3	36	1	Some gun control advocates try to say that the word ���people�۝ here refers to a collective body of people, (a state) meaning there is no personal right to keep and bear arms.	Now that said, one has to wonder why people for gun control or anti gun types keep telling people that defend the right to bear arms that they could not win a fight.
1	9507	8682	40	11	1	1	3	1	Right now it is against the law for the government to keep a database of gun owners, that that law would have to be changed, and I think you also know this.	because I've made a legitimate point that not all gun owners abide by the law?
2.666666667	764	7482	140	7	1	21	21	1	That most people can't be trusted, so we should have more laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.	Why do people that want what they call reasonable limits on the right to bear arms believe criminals will obey a law stating criminals cannot have guns?
4	25130	820	82	22	3	13	11	1	All gun control laws do is stop law abiding citizens from having guns!	where gun control laws prohibit good law abiding citizens from carrying a gun to protect themselves and others.
3	10318	8757	16	8	1	7	0	1	If more guns in the hands of law abiding citizens were the answer then it would be logical to expect the US to have one of the lowest rates of mass shootings in the world instead of the highest.	Do you think that it is a huge coincidence that nations in which fewer law abiding citizens own guns such as Australia and the UK also have much lower rates of gun crime?
1.333333333	8025	623	29	7	1	1	2	1	It is interesting how people that want to ban the right to bear arms never apply their logic to the rights they like.	Since they've never done this it's only safe to assume that they hate absolutely any kind of gun and want them all banned outright without exception.
1.666666667	9463	8636	12	72	1	4	18	1	Doesn't hold together, though - you have no evidence that criminal arms supply is unaffected by gun control.	If this is the case then gun control laws will have no effect on who carries melee weapons, so you argument falls apart because 'the law abiding' can remain armed.
1.666666667	10352	25130	28	50	1	3	2	3	So if someone wants to protect themself from a wild animal do they need a gun?	So if its cause people in high crime areas want to buy guns for protection then why do they only want protection against gun murders but not other crimes.
1	764	975	140	21	1	21	3	1	Now that said, one has to wonder why people for gun control or anti gun types keep telling people that defend the right to bear arms that they could not win a fight.

1	4400	173	15	106	1	2	55	1	We have guns and we still have crime and lots of gun deaths.	It is not the legal gun doing the crime it is the illegaly owned guns, so if you take my guns the criminals have no one to stop them since they have guns we don't.

4	6651	667	7	3	1	68	15	1	Common sense gun control laws the gun haters want will only affect the law abiding citizens, not the criminals.	It is asserted, therefore, that the D.C. gun control laws irrationally prevent only law abiding citizens from owning handguns.
3.333333333	7997	1660	21	64	1	4	10	1	The language and historical intent of the Second Amendment mandates recognition of the individual right to keep and bear firearms and other personal weapons.	Anybody else in American history able to lend credibility to your belief that the Second Amendment was all about gun control and how gun ownership was never intended to be an individual right?

2	10662	48	87	50	1	4	6	1	It was felt by many (not all) at the time that such weapons were not military weapons and thus did not fall under the protection of the Second Amendment or the right to bear arms in their own state constitutions.	"In the dicta from a maritime law case the Supreme Court commented that state laws restricting concealed weapons do not infringe upon the right to bear arms protected by the Federal Second Amendment."""
1	4400	10133	44	10	1	15	6	1	Which gun right laws do you support?The right to ban them?you are as anti-gun as they come.Galileo no offense, because you make no pretense about it.	If you cannot demonstrate that more citizens owning guns leads to more violent crime, if the stats in fact support the opposite, what reason is there to ban guns?
1.666666667	15153	6753	2	139	3	6	5	1	If people are going to carry guns for protection, they should be encouraged to put lots and lots of rounds through the gun.	People constantly trumpet about how having a gun means that they can protect themselves, but first they must be able to fire the gun on another human being, something that most people find hard to do.
2.333333333	296	8035	40	116	1	9	1	1	Are you saying that since all guns have been banned for civilian use in Countries like England, that murders by guns and gun crimes have gone to absolute zero there?	I see you always use gun crime rates as an argument, are you totally uninterested in other types of violent crimes, what happens when all guns are banned and we only have knife crimes?
2	1029	623	25	126	1	2	3	1	Anybody that wants gun control laws that infringe on the right to bear arms is a gun haters!	The anti gun/gun control advocate way at dealing with deaths caused by guns is to limit the right to bear arms.
3	9463	185	15	25	1	2	1	1	You can not use this as evidence that the reduction in crime is due to the gun ban.	Your attempt to use rates of BJS to prove gun deaths, which have actually gone down despite huge increases of guns, fell flat as it has remained flat or decreased while other weapons were used in 2/3rds of the crimes.
1.333333333	10922	10783	1	47	1	16	1	1	In some states, some guns are just not allowed and it sticks as a law.	Since 1980, forty-four states have passed some form of law that allows gun owners to carry concealed weapons outside their homes for personal protection.
1	8543	296	13	40	1	10	9	1	I see you always use gun crime rates as an argument, are you totally uninterested in other types of violent crimes, what happens when all guns are banned and we only have knife crimes?	I do not believe OTHERS should not have guns, I think criminals and psychos who are yet to convict a gun crime should not have guns.
1	8092	9336	6	22	3	2	5	1	BTW, It's weird how you always whine that the rights of criminals are violated, you're against Megan's Law, you think pedophilia should be legalized, and you want guns taken out of as many hands as possible.	now imagine if no criminals could get hold of a gun, you wouldn't need a protection, as no criminals have guns.
1	8053	9270	1	74	1	4	10	1	Sure you say guns don't kill people but people kill people, but the gun is only a tool or a means to that end.	So if you want to ban guns, 1,531,764 people will get killed or injured, and you'll only take guns out of the hands of those who don't even commit gun crimes.
2.666666667	6125	8168	1	103	1	76	1	1	And as far as carrying in public, as long as I have commited no crime, then why should anyone need know I have my gun.	Her: I don't think people should be allowed to carry guns.
1.666666667	9037	8929	142	90	1	9	5	1	All of the Gun control you call for has been tried in other countries and the Criminals Still import guns in with their drugs.	Neither you nor your side will admit that criminals use guns or other weapons to rob banks or citizens for money or other valuables to support their drug habits or other criminal achievements.
1	9820	10351	69	11	1	2	1	1	So I think gun control on the magnitude you want would effect it, how could it not?	"So, no, I wouldn't say there was any ""gun control"" as you (Galileo) tried to pass off as early gun control laws."
5	10154	7938	1	1	1	124	86	1	In sum, we hold that the District�۪s ban on handgun possession in the home violates the Second Amendment, as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense.	In sum, we hold that the District's ban on handgun possession in the home violates the Second Amendment, as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense.
4	1131	25130	39	82	1	1	8	3	Gun laws and bans are put in place that only affect good law abiding free citizens.	Gun free zones are areas where law-abiding citizens are forbidden to carry guns by law.
3	173	953	88	6	1	3	9	1	And I don't think that the second amendment is a good argument against gun control since the federal courts have not recognized gun-control as being offensive to the second amendment.	Since that ruling most lower federal courts have continued to reject the argument that the second amendment protects an indivual right to own a gun.
1.666666667	546	1131	215	89	1	1	5	1	You propose to abolish gun free zones, and allow people to carry guns into schools.	As far as guns, it is difficult to say because currently as in the past, you are not allowed to carry a gun on board an aircraft.
1	296	8414	17	3	1	11	2	1	As I think some people who wuv their guns would just XXXX the ignorant politician away with their newly illegal gun.	Now tell me, how is gun control going to stop people from making their own?
1.333333333	4400	5376	227	1	1	2	4	1	I think we recognize that gun control laws can reduce the number of criminals owning guns although not disarm every criminal.	But I do not believe that a gun ban will make us any safer.
1.333333333	7507	28080	77	425	1	10	1	3	Do not ban guns when guns are the tools of man.	Roughly one person would die every minute if guns were banned.
1	8015	8099	1	69	1	0	1	1	The fact that you've committed murder is irrelevant and the only thing that matters is if a person has a gun?	Ian brought up the point that guns make you more likely to kill a person.
2.333333333	38588	2357	4	18	3	4	6	1	Law abiding citizens obey the law, there can surely be no reason to prohibit them form having guns.	I see, so banning guns just stops law abiding citizens from having them, yet your family of criminals buys them from people who legally obtained them, or has them legally obtained for them.
1	7991	9037	53	33	1	6	8	1	We support letting people who already have guns actually being allowed to carry them, but I haven't seen anyone saying that we have to get hundreds of thousands of more guns bought up and distributed.	I don't care about the number of people who buy guns or how many they buy per day or per month.
1	296	560	62	30	1	5	13	1	Gun haters must attack people defending the right to bear arms by calling them fanatics.	People that defend the right to bear arms that demand laws that punish criminals by keeping them in prison thus keeping guns away from them.
3	623	1103	94	34	1	27	3	1	Gun control laws do not affect criminals because criminals do not obey these laws.	Simple if the gun haters did not want your guns why do gun haters only want gun control laws that law abiding citizens obey and criminals do not?
1.333333333	28080	8048	215	20	3	0	1	1	If guns are banned, the only people who will surrender them are those who commit nearly no gun crime at all.	Guns are dangerous even though when they are banned people will still make them people think that they will still use them less people will use them less deaths will be by guns.
1	160	534	8	95	1	7	4	1	If that means gun control then so be it, but it does not.	Gun Control does not work, well unless you mean by working that crime sky rockets in which case I would have to agree with you and then question your motives as to why you would want it here.
2.666666667	1073	8042	45	6	1	1	15	1	Less gun control probably means more criminals will have guns, however it also means more civilian lives will be saved.	Do you think that a gun-ban in the long run would mean that more criminals get their hands on guns or that less criminals get their hands on guns?
1	8387	2846	15	4	1	1	17	1	He is also someone who dislikes guns and has mostly written on the side of gun control.	Gun control should be left to the person holding the gun.
1.666666667	173	623	98	30	1	4	15	1	The only problem with gun hater pilot�۪s common sense bs is that the dangerous criminals these laws are meant to keep guns away from do not obey gun control laws!	Gun haters are like the dangerous criminals the gun haters want to keep guns away from.
1.666666667	907	546	4	153	1	0	17	1	I think the government has taken responsibility for the law abiding citizens by ensuring that nobody can carry a gun or other dangerous weapon on board a plane.	I think what is also important is that nobody to my knowledge is saying that a law abiding citizen shouldn't have the right to own a gun.
2	28080	8541	179	6	3	1	2	1	By that brand of logic, any gun law is specifically aimed at reducing criminal use of guns, including a complete ban.	Countries that ban guns or implement stricter laws concerning firearms have lower crime rates.
1	15153	28080	2	443	3	6	0	3	Making guns illegal wouldn't solve anything except to take them away from people that want to defend themselves.	People constantly trumpet about how having a gun means that they can protect themselves, but first they must be able to fire the gun on another human being, something that most people find hard to do.
2.333333333	546	1194	215	3	1	1	14	1	I think laws stating that you should not be allowed to carry guns onto airplanes or into schools are examples of common sense gun control laws meant to protect people.	As far as guns, it is difficult to say because currently as in the past, you are not allowed to carry a gun on board an aircraft.
1	10057	123	111	11	1	24	4	1	Most violent crime with guns occurs at knife fighting range.	The crime comes from using the gun (or any other weapon) to violate the rights of others.
1	7964	9259	16	15	1	5	0	1	No, but they might like to challenge the conclusion that states with less strict firearm laws are more often the source of guns used in crimes, in other states, than guns from states with stricter gun laws.	It is legal to own weapons in this country, they are just tightly controlled, and as a result we have far less gun crime (particularly where it's not related to organised crime).
3.333333333	51	28080	21	503	1	5	5	3	If we're going to ban guns,we might as well bans knives,fireworks,and even computers.	If we allow banning of AP bullets, big bullets will be next, then shotguns, then pistols, then hunting rifles, then bows and arrows, then knives, then nail-clippers, then bats.
2	1660	991	25	15	1	1	0	2	Yeah, thing is that the second ammendment makes the point that guns should be allowed because a _well organised militia_ is an important tool for a nation.	The organized militia is equivalent to the well regulated militia of the second amendment.
2	185	185	26	19	1	17	0	1	Gun haters will stop when the right to bear arms is banned!	Gun haters if the 2nd amend did not protect the right to bear arms then all guns in America would be banned.
1	8711	10154	163	35	1	3	10	1	You claimed that the Supreme Court gave the green light to all kinds of bans and restrictions on guns and ammunition, something that never took place.	Even back in the 60's gun owners were saying that if you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns, and gun safety being stressed, and maybe even mandatory for children will produce benefits.
1	560	25798	6	63	1	7	29	3	Therefore you feel more guns is the solution to stopping gun crime.	You can debate that without guns there would be more deaths to other weapons although you can't debate it would be to the same extent as gun murders and crimes would be.
2.666666667	28080	1660	177	77	3	4	4	1	The 2nd Amendment gives citizens the rights to own a gun, not the Militia Act.	The second amendment says MILITIAS have the right to carry guns, not private citizens, and that is why the militias are there to protects us and are composed of....private citizens.
1	9054	10057	19	122	1	12	10	1	And if you have complaints about modern day gun laws such as those that ban the mentally ill and felons from possessing arms then remember that recent Supreme Court rulings already have shown their approval for such laws.

"In recent years it has been suggested that the Second Amendment protects the ""collective"" right of states to maintain militias, while it does not protect the right of ""the people"" to keep and bear arms."
2	173	28080	106	460	1	48	12	3	To suit the people that believe guns should be completely illegal....I do feel that stricter laws need to be enforced to acquire such equipment.	In my view I think that complete gun control helps solve a major problem in crime and it would allow people to feel safer because they wouldn't need to have a gun to protect themselves.
2	1789	9559	7	18	1	33	2	1	To purchase a firearm in a commercial shop, one needs to have a Waffenerwerbsschein (weapon acquisition permit).	ATF then obtains the sale records which every FFL dealer is required to maintain for every firearm and learns when the gun was received by the dealer and when and to whom the particular gun was sold.
1	10622	1073	113	50	1	14	24	1	The second amendment is the smoke detector of the bill of rights.	The only rights at risk in this entire thing are first amendment rights.
1	8387	534	15	95	1	1	4	1	If that means gun control then so be it, but it does not.	Gun control should be left to the person holding the gun.
2.666666667	623	49	94	89	1	27	0	1	A gun haters is a person that wants gun control laws that infringe on the right to bear arms or wants to ban the right to bear arms.	Simple if the gun haters did not want your guns why do gun haters only want gun control laws that law abiding citizens obey and criminals do not?
1	7840	28080	10	57	1	1	0	3	all guns are used for is killing, they are weapons.	Civilians with other types of gun should be shot on sight by them.
3	9738	6116	35	12	1	12	1	1	The homicide rate has climbed drasticaly with every gun control measure.	On average, the states that have done the most to regulate private gun sales appear to have lower firearm death rates and lower firearm homicide rates.
2.666666667	2417	9191	58	19	1	6	2	1	The logic of less guns in law abiding citizens hands means less gun crime is clearly insane.	We could hypothesize that if guns are banned then law abiding citizens who usually didn't carry or own guns before the ban will be less likely to face armed opponents.
1.666666667	9059	9037	27	66	1	13	4	1	So guns kept in a home appear to attract criminals rather than deter them.	You have been shown the facts that most criminals get their guns from family members or they steal them, even from cops.
2	28080	28080	297	415	3	0	4	3	Something else you must keep in mind is that if we outlaw guns, the only people with guns will be outlaws, this leaves no defense for law abiding citizens.	If today we were to ban guns all the law abiding citizens would give up their firearms and protection.
3.666666667	820	296	22	102	1	11	0	1	Gun control laws will not work because criminals do not obey gun control laws!	All gun control laws do is stop law abiding citizens from having guns!
1.333333333	4400	8168	206	103	1	3	1	1	And as far as carrying in public, as long as I have commited no crime, then why should anyone need know I have my gun.	I do see the sense in some measures such as restricting access to guns for people who have committed violent crimes.
3.333333333	546	623	121	30	1	2	15	1	The only problem with gun hater pilot�۪s common sense bs is that the dangerous criminals these laws are meant to keep guns away from do not obey gun control laws!	Criminals kill people so gun haters like gun hater pilot want to pass gun control laws that only law abiding citizens obey!
1.666666667	9580	8004	75	20	1	13	0	1	You've yet to explain anything that would support your position of the Second Amendment being out of date.	You keep claiming that you're not of the anti-gun camp, that you actually support the Second Amendment.
3.666666667	8035	7602	75	15	1	0	11	1	Look at Washington D.C. By far the absolute strictest laws in the entire nation, they STILL need gun shot sensors because people are STILL being shot and killed on a regular basis!	Even in Japan, the nation with the most absolute strictest gun laws in the world, criminals are still getting their hands on banned guns and killing people with them.
1.666666667	10441	589	12	61	1	12	19	1	The issue here is your wish to carry a gun as according to a law, which you don't really respect anyway, because you're quite happy to circumvent it all the time.	IF you previously had laws that made openly carrying weapons illegal, and you then pass a concealed carry law, if somebody is carrying a gun and it is not concealed, they are breaking the law.
1	1145	28080	66	516	1	2	0	3	people who want to kill, will kill if you ban guns, they will kill with knives, or something else.	The fact that you like cars is why you will tolerate the fact that more kids are killed by cars then guns.
1	8092	7482	6	18	3	2	9	1	Only why would you need gun registration if guns were illegal?	now imagine if no criminals could get hold of a gun, you wouldn't need a protection, as no criminals have guns.
1	9636	9820	31	69	1	2	2	1	"So, no, I wouldn't say there was any ""gun control"" as you (Galileo) tried to pass off as early gun control laws."	Simply put, you should have to prove that the gun control you seek will do what you say it will do before burdening the Constitution with a load up of Liberal wishes and hopes!
1.333333333	6753	10371	92	8	1	29	0	1	The argument isn't that guns promote or cause crime, it is that when crimes happen having a gun involved causes more damage.	"Those who claim that Australia suffered a ""crime wave"" as a result of new gun laws often cite as evidence unrelated figures for common assault or sexual assault (no weapon) and armed robbery (any weapon)."
1	7507	1543	8	108	1	1	2	1	Using a shotgun or an AK-47 will get the job done, so I don't see the need to ban assault weapons.	I think it is interesting that gun nuts always claim that when guns are banned people will just use knives instead, yet we find that with guns prohibited there are still only 200 deaths a year from knife like weapons.
4.666666667	623	49	126	89	1	3	0	1	A gun haters is a person that wants gun control laws that infringe on the right to bear arms or wants to ban the right to bear arms.	Anybody that wants gun control laws that infringe on the right to bear arms is a gun haters!
2	25130	9998	34	10	3	15	0	1	Let's be honest, it won't result in any more or less gun deaths and even if it resulted in more gun deaths it would be worth having the amendment.	However, even though there were less deaths, there was a surge in gun crime, death and non-death related, after the ban on guns.
1	546	173	101	98	1	3	4	1	Gun haters are like the dangerous criminals the gun haters want to keep guns away from.	Notice not one of the common sense gun control laws gun hater pilot is demanding is to punish dangerous criminals by keeping them in prison to keep guns away from them!
1.333333333	10735	9014	35	52	1	15	1	1	Most gun owners are just ordinary people who happen to own a firearm.	There is no reason why gun owners should have to pay taxes to support police protection for people not wanting to own guns.
1.666666667	10145	7651	35	140	1	12	2	1	A gun ban would make guns on the same level as drugs....	Should a drug user, a felon, be banned from possessing WEAPONS, especially guns??
1	8858	7780	161	112	1	7	1	1	Burglars do not use guns, muggers do not use guns.	When criminals are forced to use toy guns, your gun control policies are working.
2.333333333	565	667	24	3	1	17	13	1	Gun hater Sarah Brady like al gun hater blame the right to bear arms for the crimes committed with guns.	Gun haters will do any thing to ban the right to bear arms!
1.333333333	6777	28080	31	588	1	15	5	3	also, a gun is only dangerous if its used by the wrong person.	Bad Gun control are things that hinder a lawfull person from being able to purchase and use firearms.
1.333333333	9211	8682	29	11	1	1	3	1	Right now it is against the law for the government to keep a database of gun owners, that that law would have to be changed, and I think you also know this.	First you say no law will ever stop criminals from getting guns but now youre saying that criminals are never gun owners.
1	764	8858	140	247	1	21	13	1	If so, they need to explain why they would leave some firearms, handguns say, in the hands of the people which are involved in more officer deaths than the ones they recommend banning.	Why do people that want what they call reasonable limits on the right to bear arms believe criminals will obey a law stating criminals cannot have guns?
1	7364	9820	42	52	1	4	0	1	The only people that're going to get shot are the ones that're trying to either hurt or kill me or my loved ones.	Second of all, I wholeheartedly believe in the thinking that guns don't kill people, people kill people.
2.333333333	1461	764	15	36	1	5	6	1	This makes sense when you consider that the second amendment protects the right of the people to bear arms in connection with an organized militia.	I don`t reallly see the inconsistency unless you view the right to keep andbear arms as a right that should be protected.
1.666666667	9507	8105	40	66	1	1	9	1	I would support any law that target criminals, but I will not support you as long as you target lawfull gun owners.	because I've made a legitimate point that not all gun owners abide by the law?
3.333333333	8182	7507	287	21	1	18	3	1	To inact a law that makes a crime of illegal gun ownership has no effect on criminal ownership of guns.	And that assumes that gun control will have no effect on illegal firearm ownership.
3	10662	10154	22	1	1	16	124	1	In sum, we hold that the District's ban on handgun possession in the home violates the Second Amendment, as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense.	"Government does not possess the authority to enact a total ban on firearm owners actually transporting their firearms, it violates the ""bear"" of the ""keep and bear"" provision of the second amendment."
1	28080	36399	57	19	3	0	4	3	"Even ""If criminals keep their guns"",(if we were to confiscate all guns) "" they wont be able to use them."	all guns are used for is killing, they are weapons.
2	4400	6116	206	1	1	3	45	1	I will give a list of the most restrictive states and the least restrictive states and arrange them by the number of violent crimes per 100,000 people.	I do see the sense in some measures such as restricting access to guns for people who have committed violent crimes.
1.666666667	991	1103	5	42	2	0	2	1	I can understand your belief that gun control won't work and that owning guns is a good thing, I don't agree with it, but is hardly beyond comprehension.	I don't believe guns are good for anything, and I see no use in having them, but I believe it is everybody's right to produce or keep one, as it is just a weapon like anything else.
1.333333333	9919	637	1	6	1	56	3	1	Of course if a hate groups such as the gun haters want to ban a right they will claim this!	I believe in gun control (and wrote this piece to satirize pro-gunners) because I hate guns and want to see them all banned, which is why I own guns and also enjoy reading firearms-related literature.
1.333333333	991	8008	5	22	2	0	10	1	Again, I don't think anybody will argue that owning a gun prevents crime.	I don't believe guns are good for anything, and I see no use in having them, but I believe it is everybody's right to produce or keep one, as it is just a weapon like anything else.
2.333333333	9009	8636	95	72	1	9	18	1	Doesn't hold together, though - you have no evidence that criminal arms supply is unaffected by gun control.	You still have to prove that gun control equals crime control and your admission that it does not is proof that it is about control and dependency on government to protect you when they have no obligation to do so.
3.666666667	296	667	77	3	1	11	15	1	Common sense gun control laws the gun haters want will only affect the law abiding citizens, not the criminals.	and who commits crimes, Criminals, so if you take guns away from law abiding citizens insuring that criminals will still be able to get weapons will have more targets to attack because people don't have any defense against criminals.
4	28080	669	179	46	3	1	10	1	The reality is that in developed nations with stricter gun laws than the US there are less outlaws owning and using guns.	Countries that ban guns or implement stricter laws concerning firearms have lower crime rates.
3.333333333	8711	9100	21	1	1	3	22	1	Another large source of guns used in crimes are unlicensed street dealers who either get their guns through illegal transactions with licensed dealers, straw purchases, or from gun thefts.	Straw Purchase, or stolen, receiving stolen property, illegally transporting a firearms across state lines, gun trafficking, and finally transporting illegal guns across the boarder.
3	4400	6116	10	12	1	2	1	1	The homicide rate has climbed drasticaly with every gun control measure.	All one can reasonably conclude is that more firearms does not increase the homicide rate, nor does less guns reduce it.
3.666666667	546	30649	121	7	1	2	0	3	Gun control laws only control the guns in the hands of people who follow laws.	Criminals kill people so gun haters like gun hater pilot want to pass gun control laws that only law abiding citizens obey!
1.333333333	4400	36399	15	19	1	2	4	3	"Even ""If criminals keep their guns"",(if we were to confiscate all guns) "" they wont be able to use them."	It is not the legal gun doing the crime it is the illegaly owned guns, so if you take my guns the criminals have no one to stop them since they have guns we don't.
2.666666667	25130	6116	16	12	3	5	1	1	The homicide rate has climbed drasticaly with every gun control measure.	You didn't address that since we have started adding more and more gun control that violent crimes have gone up and how even though America is #1 in gun ownership it tanks only 107th in homicide rates.

Second, the only reason that you would bother notifying the police is if you think there is some possibility that the person will be charged with trying to illegally obtain a gun.
1.333333333	37823	9259	93	15	3	112	0	1	No, but they might like to challenge the conclusion that states with less strict firearm laws are more often the source of guns used in crimes, in other states, than guns from states with stricter gun laws.	Please tell the murder victims in these other countries that gun control works.
2	8329	8858	118	138	1	9	3	1	The manufacturer tells them who the gun was shipped to, the dealer is contacted, and the dealer informs the ATF or the police of who the gun was sold to and when.	Federal law doesn't give them authority to require sale reports of multiple shotgun and rifle sales, only handguns.
3	623	674	29	5	1	7	21	1	Gun haters are the extremist hate group demanding to ban the right to bear arms!	But gun hater pilot will demand that the right to bear arms be limited or banned to keep criminals from getting guns.
1.333333333	185	28080	26	241	1	8	0	3	Then we should ban so stupid people can't kill people with guns.	If gun bans worked there would be no gun deaths in the countries that have banned guns.
2.666666667	10330	8509	26	1	1	25	1	1	Those who would remove our freedom to defend ourselves always seem to link the number of guns to the high rate of gun crime.	In short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns.
1	9820	8858	69	211	1	2	6	1	You say that gun control must not be effective because the study's conclusions about gun control were inconclusive.	"So, no, I wouldn't say there was any ""gun control"" as you (Galileo) tried to pass off as early gun control laws."
1	7780	673	112	1	1	1	3	1	Ok, so are the gun haters claiming the police department are giving the guns criminals use for crime back to the criminals?	Burglars do not use guns, muggers do not use guns.
2.666666667	2417	28080	58	415	1	6	4	3	Something else you must keep in mind is that if we outlaw guns, the only people with guns will be outlaws, this leaves no defense for law abiding citizens.

2.333333333	8048	28080	20	40	1	1	2	3	You people fail to realize if someone is intent on committing a crime they will most likely GET A GUN, stopping the selling of guns will just restrict civilians from protecting themselves.	If guns are banned, the only people who will surrender them are those who commit nearly no gun crime at all.
1	7364	991	42	6	1	4	3	2	Many people who would never dream of shooting a person can own a gun simply for the artistry of a well made machine, people hunt with guns as well.	Second of all, I wholeheartedly believe in the thinking that guns don't kill people, people kill people.
1	8858	8682	34	11	1	22	3	1	Right now it is against the law for the government to keep a database of gun owners, that that law would have to be changed, and I think you also know this.	Also once you become an agent of the government you stop having right, you have authorities and you're controlled by the people the Constitution is supposed to protect you against.
1	7991	38588	53	4	1	6	4	3	I see, so banning guns just stops law abiding citizens from having them, yet your family of criminals buys them from people who legally obtained them, or has them legally obtained for them.	I don't care about the number of people who buy guns or how many they buy per day or per month.

1	407	9681	5	141	1	5	2	1	They do not have the expressed, enumerated power to pass any law regarding guns in the constitution.	Not only will the criminals still have access to guns, but they will also have the added knowledge that either the person they intend to rob does not have a gun or they are breaking the law.
1.666666667	9463	8636	7	74	1	0	20	1	I have a better theory as to why there's a supposed smaller availability of guns to criminals in the UK; because there are less people and obviously fewer guns were ever made or imported to begin with.	There's no evidence to prove the believe that when guns are less available, less criminals will be armed than if guns were more readily available.
1.333333333	669	7840	39	3	1	0	9	1	That will take the criminals off the street and with them off the street there are no gun control concerns.	gun control doesent solve anything in fact it makes crime go up because the criminals will always get their guns and your only disarming the law abiding citizens thus making them easy victims from the criminals.
1	7991	185	8	25	1	4	1	1	You can not use this as evidence that the reduction in crime is due to the gun ban.	Keeping violent criminals in prison would do far more to reduce gun crime than banning guns.
1	4400	28080	262	234	1	10	14	3	Guns don't kill people, people kill people: absolutely true, but guns allow people to kill people with greater efficiency, which is not necessarily a good thing outside of the battlefield.	Also: More people are killed in car accidents than are killed by guns.
1	1284	5376	19	2	1	6	2	1	The reason we ban felons from being armed (which I don't agree with, either they're still in jail or they are considered law-abiding citizens in my book.	I guess the criminals are comfortable with the fact they will not be confronted with a armed citizen.
1	10154	10133	35	10	1	10	6	1	Which gun right laws do you support?The right to ban them?you are as anti-gun as they come.Galileo no offense, because you make no pretense about it.	You claimed that the Supreme Court gave the green light to all kinds of bans and restrictions on guns and ammunition, something that never took place.
2.333333333	2927	2927	82	12	1	2	28	1	Unless the second amendment is recognised as an individual right, and given the full protection of law as other rights are, there is nothing to say that a law could not be passed tomorrow banning all weapons in this country.	Some passionately assert that the Amendment protects an individual's right to own guns.
3	339	9601	29	14	1	8	6	1	All that does is imply that crime rate depends on more than just the presence/absence of guns - it disproves 'more guns = more crime' about as much as it disproves 'more guns = less crime'.	"Finally it mentions that Swiss ""gun control"" is not the reason for the low crime rates and, granted, it also mentions that this system is not proof that more guns means less crime."

The right to carry concealed weapons across state lines exists only in the fertile constitutional imagination of the gun lobby.
2.333333333	8123	20890	8	24	1	3	0	3	If guns are banned, the only people that will be affected will be the people that buy guns for protection from criminals, who get their guns illegally anyway.	If gun control will not affect criminal ownership of guns and people will always be able to get a firearm if they want, why should a government make the effort to ban firearms as a precursor to atrocities?
1.666666667	7987	9270	35	74	1	6	10	1	Sure you say guns don't kill people but people kill people, but the gun is only a tool or a means to that end.	So now you're saying that just because somebody owns a gun, they're somehow more likely to start killing people than somebody who doesn't own a gun?
1.333333333	10149	28080	1	150	1	0	1	3	with regard to the fact that most gun crime is from illegl guns, in that case why not make all guns illegal.

2.333333333	7967	7482	2	7	1	1	21	1	That most people can't be trusted, so we should have more laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.	And by the same token the anti-gun crowd believe that honest people can't be trusted, yet criminals can; unless there are laws that reinforce the Second Amendment right, which will make criminals more likely to get a gun.
1	25130	10735	38	67	3	2	12	1	One such person who is prohibited by federal law from having a firearm at all is the convicted felon:	...Virtually never are murderers the ordinary, law-abiding people against whom gun bans are aimed.

1	8543	8008	13	22	1	10	10	1	Again, I don't think anybody will argue that owning a gun prevents crime.	I do not believe OTHERS should not have guns, I think criminals and psychos who are yet to convict a gun crime should not have guns.
4.333333333	674	49	5	89	1	21	0	1	A gun haters is a person that wants gun control laws that infringe on the right to bear arms or wants to ban the right to bear arms.	Gun haters are the extremist hate group demanding to ban the right to bear arms!
2	8466	1131	15	135	1	1	9	1	IF you want them armed, why not let law abiding citizens who have passed a background check, a firearms safety check, and a marksmanship test carry their guns?	DC doesn't need to have an age restriction on gun ownership, because no matter what their laws say, you still have to be at least 18 to pass a federal background check to buy a gun.
1.333333333	28080	657	443	46	3	0	10	1	Simple if gun haters want people defending the right to bear arms to be in militias, why would you want the militias to have lesser weapons then the enemies they are defending against?	Making guns illegal wouldn't solve anything except to take them away from people that want to defend themselves.
3.666666667	969	975	11	17	1	17	4	1	Please note that the argument is that the reason people shall have the right to keep and bear arms is in order to maintain a well regulated militia.	2) ensure that the right to keep and bear arms for a militia is not infringed.
3.666666667	8099	1131	14	89	1	3	5	1	You propose to abolish gun free zones, and allow people to carry guns into schools.	You're saying that guns should be allowed into school in order to allow some students (or teachers) to defend themselves if they were attacked.
3.666666667	1131	1131	39	42	1	1	1	1	Unarmed law-abiding citizens are victims of gun crimes because criminals do not obey the gun ban in that gun free zone.	Gun free zones are areas where law-abiding citizens are forbidden to carry guns by law.
4.666666667	296	30649	101	7	1	0	0	3	Gun control laws only control the guns in the hands of people who follow laws.	Gun control will not work because criminals do not obey gun control laws.
2	8405	4400	24	204	1	2	4	1	It's just that on these forums, the words 'gun control' usually refer to extremely tight gun laws, or outright banning of guns.	Gun control' does not mean a ban on all self-defence
1	1103	339	42	72	1	2	7	1	I really can't do that if I don't have a gun do I. Your responsible for your own protection, not me.	I can understand your belief that gun control won't work and that owning guns is a good thing, I don't agree with it, but is hardly beyond comprehension.
2.666666667	2927	2927	30	33	1	12	1	1	"Why can a state attach limits ""in their own individual RKBA"" (such as prohibited concealed carry) that supercede the second amendment- unless the second amendment does not protect concealed carry."	(i.e. restrictions on concealed carry, laws against brandishing) but we can not ban the carrying of arms altogether since that would violate the second amendment.
3	969	25130	12	38	1	6	9	3	"In recent years it has been suggested that the Second Amendment protects the ""collective"" right of states to maintain militias, while it does not protect the right of ""the people"" to keep and bear arms."	Even if today's well-regulated militia were the National Guard, the Second Amendment still protects an individual right to keep and bear arms.
1	8008	10098	28	376	1	2	12	1	Illegal firearms can be identified and linked to other firearms and to crimes and criminals.	The problem is that widespread guns means greater criminal access to guns which means greater criminal gun use which means bad things.
1	1131	10133	135	10	1	9	6	1	Which gun right laws do you support?The right to ban them?you are as anti-gun as they come.Galileo no offense, because you make no pretense about it.	IF you want them armed, why not let law abiding citizens who have passed a background check, a firearms safety check, and a marksmanship test carry their guns?
2.666666667	8858	1660	86	77	1	8	4	1	The 2nd Amendment gives citizens the rights to own a gun, not the Militia Act.	The 2nd amendment only protects a states right to own a Militia.
2.333333333	4400	7507	227	8	1	2	1	1	I think it is interesting that gun nuts always claim that when guns are banned people will just use knives instead, yet we find that with guns prohibited there are still only 200 deaths a year from knife like weapons.	But I do not believe that a gun ban will make us any safer.
3	25130	185	34	26	3	15	9	1	Since there are gun deaths in countries that have banned guns, the gun bans did not work.	However, even though there were less deaths, there was a surge in gun crime, death and non-death related, after the ban on guns.
1	28080	8777	503	27	3	5	0	1	If we look at D.C. we can see that people who had registered their guns before the gun ban were allowed to keep their guns after the ban took effect.	If we're going to ban guns,we might as well bans knives,fireworks,and even computers.
1.666666667	623	975	120	30	1	9	58	1	Every person has a right to keep and bear arms for the defense of himself and the state.	********* logic is for companies and governments to deny a person the right to bears arms to defend ones self then not be held responsible when these companies and governments fail to protect the unarmed citizens!
1.666666667	185	28080	26	248	1	9	24	3	there are too many gun deaths and while there will never be a ban in America i find it appalling that so many fight to prevent gun restrictions and background checks.	Since there are gun deaths in countries that have banned guns, the gun bans did not work.
2	657	10330	70	26	1	1	25	1	In short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns.	They looked at gun ownership, drug use and a history of physical fights and found that each of these factors is associated with a higher homicide rate in the home.
2.666666667	8159	8042	40	6	1	2	15	1	Less gun control probably means more criminals will have guns, however it also means more civilian lives will be saved.	Gun control does nothing to make anyone safer or save lives.
1.666666667	9636	10145	128	1	1	59	1	1	The Second Amendment, the right to be armed for all legal and lawful reasons, is finally recognized as not just a fundamental right, but an individual right held by the people, not any state or government.	The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.
1	10371	673	18	1	1	5	5	1	The only way the person would get the gun back is if the person was found not guilty.	The only case you could possibly make is more accidents with more guns at gun shows.
2.333333333	10705	7543	20	30	1	1	0	3	It's pointless people with criminal backgrounds aren't buying guns from gun stores (all of which already run background checks) there are no background checks on the black market and laws won't change that.	The number of background checks carried out for the purpose of buying a firearm have increased.
4	8182	8159	118	40	1	1	2	1	Gun control does nothing to make anyone safer or save lives.	I haven't seen anyone explain how another gun control law will fight crime, how it'll make anyone safer, how it'll put criminals away longer, etc.
1	28080	8777	241	27	3	0	0	1	If we look at D.C. we can see that people who had registered their guns before the gun ban were allowed to keep their guns after the ban took effect.	Then we should ban so stupid people can't kill people with guns.
1.666666667	991	4813	5	3	2	0	2	1	I think a better debate would be when should gun control start?	I don't believe guns are good for anything, and I see no use in having them, but I believe it is everybody's right to produce or keep one, as it is just a weapon like anything else.
3.333333333	4400	10352	10	38	1	2	12	1	That said, the idea that non gun homicides dont increase does not show causation between high gun ownership and increased murder rates.	All one can reasonably conclude is that more firearms does not increase the homicide rate, nor does less guns reduce it.
2.666666667	8654	1103	44	15	1	51	1	1	In order to have a 'well regulated' militia you can not bar the civilian populace of its right to keep and bear arms!	When you look at this case, SCOTUS is telling us that it believes individual citizens have a right to keep and bear military grade firearms, and that such an armed populace historically formed the backbone for an effective militia.
1	8035	8182	47	74	1	1	3	1	If a gun used to commit crimes isn't found in the registry, then the registry isn't much of a valuable crime fighting tool is it?	Gun ownership is a protected right, and the fact that criminals use guns in the commission of crime will never change this fact.
3.666666667	8123	2417	8	72	1	3	2	1	Which is why the ban is a bit of a poor compromise, they've banned guns for law abiding people but they've not done enough to make sure criminals don't have them.	If gun control will not affect criminal ownership of guns and people will always be able to get a firearm if they want, why should a government make the effort to ban firearms as a precursor to atrocities?
1.666666667	10314	8105	30	70	1	0	1	1	I already said children could tote around their parents guns.	Do doctors really need to ask patients and their children if they own guns before applying a one size fits all approach to warning new parents about potential dangers for their children?
1	8231	9919	33	5	1	14	16	1	Criminals will always find ways to get around gun laws which is why there are a lot less criminals who own and use guns in places like the UK and Australia.	That pretty much boiled down to laws against felons having weapons, laws against the mentally defective having weapons, and laws against carrying weapons in sensitive places.
1.333333333	407	8543	5	195	1	5	17	1	The laws being proposed are serving no purpose, because they're not being enforced.	Not only will the criminals still have access to guns, but they will also have the added knowledge that either the person they intend to rob does not have a gun or they are breaking the law.
1.333333333	8426	1300	80	6	1	6	2	1	Making guns illegal, requiring background checks, banning scary looking guns, banning certain bullets and reestricting concealed carry to those who are willing to put their name, fingerprints, and such on file does nothing to control crime.	Certainly illegal transfers but I would also look at those that can't seem to secure their weapons against theft.
4.333333333	10570	10154	3	50	1	1	1	1	We're talking about deadly lethal weapons that are way more powerful than what the authors of the Second Amendment had in mind.	Of course, when the founders wrote the Second Amendment they had in mind people owning much less powerful weapons than gun owners have now.
1	296	28080	62	574	1	5	0	3	Guns don't kill people, if they did, they would go to jail for murder- not the murderers.	People that defend the right to bear arms that demand laws that punish criminals by keeping them in prison thus keeping guns away from them.
2.333333333	28080	10011	234	240	3	1	4	1	We have a right to use a gun to defend ourselves and others.	1) Protection - The argument suggests that guns protect us from dangerous individuals.
1	4813	8636	3	74	1	2	20	1	I have a better theory as to why there's a supposed smaller availability of guns to criminals in the UK; because there are less people and obviously fewer guns were ever made or imported to begin with.	I think a better debate would be when should gun control start?
1.333333333	30649	7482	7	7	3	1	21	1	That most people can't be trusted, so we should have more laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.	People who follow laws, aren't causing problems with the guns they own.
2	4813	48	8	50	1	5	6	1	It was felt by many (not all) at the time that such weapons were not military weapons and thus did not fall under the protection of the Second Amendment or the right to bear arms in their own state constitutions.	They argue that the second amendment allows the people the power of weapons so that if the government intrudes on their rights they can defend themselves.
2.333333333	28080	1543	460	108	3	12	4	1	However, I do feel that there should be very strict laws on who can purchase assault weapons.	To suit the people that believe guns should be completely illegal....I do feel that stricter laws need to be enforced to acquire such equipment.
2.666666667	534	25798	64	63	1	7	29	3	Therefore you feel more guns is the solution to stopping gun crime.	A criminal with a gun will feel a lot more confident in committing a crime than a criminal without a gun will just as a criminal will avoid those who have guns and target those who don't.
1.666666667	8770	6125	18	1	1	2	76	1	Her: I don't think people should be allowed to carry guns.	Innocent people were butchered where no guns were permitted, while nobody is being shot full of holes in the schools where carrying a gun is permitted.
1.333333333	8231	10011	33	156	1	14	1	1	Concealed carry laws put more legal guns on the street, in stores, etc. the is More Guns on the street for defensive use.	That pretty much boiled down to laws against felons having weapons, laws against the mentally defective having weapons, and laws against carrying weapons in sensitive places.
1.666666667	7929	669	95	39	1	0	0	1	gun control doesent solve anything in fact it makes crime go up because the criminals will always get their guns and your only disarming the law abiding citizens thus making them easy victims from the criminals.	A law-abiding gun nut who uses their gun in committing a crime, is a criminal, and not law-abiding.
1.666666667	50	1660	3	77	1	3	4	1	The 2nd Amendment gives citizens the rights to own a gun, not the Militia Act.	Just knowing that there are many Senators and Congressmen who would like to abolish gun rights gives credence to the fact that government could actually try to limit or ban the 2nd Amendment in the future.
0.666666667	9636	8858	31	34	1	2	22	1	Also once you become an agent of the government you stop having right, you have authorities and you're controlled by the people the Constitution is supposed to protect you against.	Simply put, you should have to prove that the gun control you seek will do what you say it will do before burdening the Constitution with a load up of Liberal wishes and hopes!
3	9014	9507	52	44	1	1	1	1	I implied that there are people with guns that are nuts, not that all gun owners are nuts...	Most gun owners are just ordinary people who happen to own a firearm.
1.333333333	10149	9099	6	70	1	3	60	1	When we factor in the usefulness of guns for self-defense against violent criminals, it's clear that normal gun owners are at less risk of criminal victimization.	Or, to put it another way, more guns = more crime, and if we could stop the illegal gun running then we would have less guns = less crime.
2.666666667	9095	10352	1	38	1	11	12	1	That said, the idea that non gun homicides dont increase does not show causation between high gun ownership and increased murder rates.	Within the United States, rural areas have higher rates of gun ownership and lower rates of murder, whites have higher rates of gun ownership than blacks and much lower murder rates.
2	10371	8008	8	22	1	0	10	1	Again, I don't think anybody will argue that owning a gun prevents crime.	The argument isn't that guns promote or cause crime, it is that when crimes happen having a gun involved causes more damage.
1	10912	7780	3	161	1	1	4	1	That includes populations, gun homicides, non gun homicides and households with weapons in them.	None are so fearful as those who need to have guns and more guns and more guns and more and more ammo, and assault weapons.
1.333333333	173	623	98	40	1	4	3	1	So gun hater pilots goal is to treat all people like criminals.	Gun haters are like the dangerous criminals the gun haters want to keep guns away from.
1.333333333	8858	2928	34	3	1	22	3	1	But now if you mention that you want to defend yourself against unfair actions by the government, it wouldn't ever hold up.	Also once you become an agent of the government you stop having right, you have authorities and you're controlled by the people the Constitution is supposed to protect you against.
1.666666667	9150	7364	13	42	1	6	4	1	Second of all, I wholeheartedly believe in the thinking that guns don't kill people, people kill people.	THey also believe that ALL guns can XXXX people apart and even an untrained person with a gun can shoot as accurately as the military.
4	6753	2280	138	5	1	6	5	2	While their by no means should be an outlaw of guns, I do believe restrictions should be put in place.	Although I still think that certain regulations need to be set in place in order to control the distribution of guns, complete gun control is not the answer; however, something still needs to be done.
2.333333333	9009	9321	110	1	1	2	12	1	Two weeks ago, concerning a case out of Chicago, the justices agreed to rule on whether the Second Amendment gives Americans a constitutional right to keep and bear arms that is enforceable against local and state gun laws.	Or that the Second Amendment only keeps the federal government from passing new gun control laws?
1	28080	28080	40	425	3	4	1	3	Do not ban guns when guns are the tools of man.	Gun ban = No civilians can protect themselves using a firearm = Criminals can illegally purchase guns, like tons already do.
1	8636	185	157	25	1	15	1	1	You can not use this as evidence that the reduction in crime is due to the gun ban.	Confession from the criminal or videotaping the transaction, or someone providing testimony that you, in fact, knew that he was a criminal, prohibited from owning a firearm, and you intended to break the law.
1.333333333	662	10133	2	16	1	4	7	1	The only law I even somewhat support is banning guns in certain areas like schools and colleges.	I do not support more funding for law enforcement + gun restrictions on the same bill before Congress.
4	7929	8977	4	15	1	0	22	1	And several states have recently passed laws allowing gun owners to carry firearms in more places ��� bars, restaurants, cars and parks.	Georgia's concealed carry law has recently been modified to allow permitted gun owners to carry concealed weapons into restuarants, on mass transit, in state parks and other venues previously off limits to any non-law-enforcement weapons.
3	669	8035	46	75	1	10	0	1	Even in Japan, the nation with the most absolute strictest gun laws in the world, criminals are still getting their hands on banned guns and killing people with them.	The reality is that in developed nations with stricter gun laws than the US there are less outlaws owning and using guns.
2	9288	10756	22	18	1	9	4	1	Define 'gun show' to include specialized gun events, as well as flea markets and other markets outside of licensed firearms shops at which 50 or more firearms, in total, are offered for sale by 2 or more persons.	Second, regulating private party sales will not render gun shows unimpor-tant as sources of trafficked crime guns; the best evidence is that most of those guns are sold by licensed retailers.
1.333333333	28080	8182	241	31	3	0	2	1	Cars kill people everyday just the same as guns, but nobody is trying to ban cars.	Then we should ban so stupid people can't kill people with guns.
2	122	9919	3	3	1	0	1	1	The only way to prevent guns from falling in the hands of criminals is by law abiding people buying every gun that is manufactured and thus leaving no guns available for criminals to buy.	The bill would also protect gun manufacturers and dealers that have allowed their weapons to fall into the hands of criminals through their own negligence.
2.333333333	9211	1103	29	30	1	1	4	1	Gun control laws do not stop criminals from getting guns.	First you say no law will ever stop criminals from getting guns but now youre saying that criminals are never gun owners.
2.666666667	1660	764	25	36	1	1	6	1	This makes sense when you consider that the second amendment protects the right of the people to bear arms in connection with an organized militia.	The organized militia is equivalent to the well regulated militia of the second amendment.
1.666666667	8092	28080	6	391	3	2	1	3	If you take away the civilian's only right to self defense, how are they suppose to defend themselves from the criminals who buy weapons and drugs from the black market illegally.	now imagine if no criminals could get hold of a gun, you wouldn't need a protection, as no criminals have guns.
3	185	11417	26	1	1	9	1	3	Some studies used against gun have been ones showing that over 50% of homicides in the US are committed with guns, while in countries with gun bans or very strict gun control have a lower amount of gun homicides.	Since there are gun deaths in countries that have banned guns, the gun bans did not work.
2.333333333	4012	8478	2	58	1	28	36	1	It did nothing to prohibit the required militia arms from being used in private concerns (such as hunting) so long as the arms were kept in a state of constant readiness for emergency militia use.	(or, for those who favor the alternative collective right view, ���the right of militia members to keep and bear their militia arms when called for by the state for militia service?�۝)
2	9100	8182	1	287	1	25	18	1	And that assumes that gun control will have no effect on illegal firearm ownership.	While many guns are taken off the street when people are arrested and any firearms in their possession are confiscated, a new study shows how easily arrestees believe they could illegally acquire another firearm.
2	37823	28080	70	443	3	3	0	3	Making guns illegal wouldn't solve anything except to take them away from people that want to defend themselves.	How can a people defend themselves from the government, unless they are able to maintain the same weapons as the government has?

4	4400	1300	26	6	1	8	5	1	"Most of the ""gun control"" laws we have in the US have no potential to impact crime at all, except perhaps making the streets safer for criminals who have an unarmed public to prey upon."	Gun control in the U.S. does not equal crime control.
2.333333333	560	296	6	40	1	7	9	1	I see you always use gun crime rates as an argument, are you totally uninterested in other types of violent crimes, what happens when all guns are banned and we only have knife crimes?	You can debate that without guns there would be more deaths to other weapons although you can't debate it would be to the same extent as gun murders and crimes would be.
2	10912	10270	3	13	1	1	1	1	A so-called assault weapon has no more kill potential than a firearm that doesn't fit the definition of an assault weapon.	None are so fearful as those who need to have guns and more guns and more guns and more and more ammo, and assault weapons.
2.666666667	2280	10149	5	49	2	5	6	1	Whether to hunt, protect their homes or defend themselves from a tyrannical government, many Americans believe that the government has no right to restrict their access to firearms.	While their by no means should be an outlaw of guns, I do believe restrictions should be put in place.
3	2357	12361	18	77	1	6	1	3	Law abiding citizens are not criminals, therefore, they have no reason to use these weapons unless for self defense of oneself or others.	Law abiding citizens obey the law, there can surely be no reason to prohibit them form having guns.

3.666666667	7987	8015	35	1	1	6	0	1	Ian brought up the point that guns make you more likely to kill a person.	So now you're saying that just because somebody owns a gun, they're somehow more likely to start killing people than somebody who doesn't own a gun?
1.333333333	907	4400	4	356	1	0	10	1	My biggest disagreement is that I think one should carry any weapon one decides to.	I think what is also important is that nobody to my knowledge is saying that a law abiding citizen shouldn't have the right to own a gun.
2.333333333	296	623	77	59	1	11	9	1	Would the simple fact that criminals and terrorist knowing that law abiding citizens can defend themselves with guns force the criminals and terrorist to not attack people?	and who commits crimes, Criminals, so if you take guns away from law abiding citizens insuring that criminals will still be able to get weapons will have more targets to attack because people don't have any defense against criminals.
3	8387	10474	15	1	1	1	5	1	If a person does not want to own or carry a gun then so be it, and if an individual does own guns then like wise.	Gun control should be left to the person holding the gun.

Not only will the criminals still have access to guns, but they will also have the added knowledge that either the person they intend to rob does not have a gun or they are breaking the law.
2.666666667	1461	173	8	89	1	9	22	1	Just because if you hang upside down and squint sideways, you can read the wording of the Second Amendment as protecting no one from anything, this does not void other places the Right to keep and bear Arms were guaranteed.	If the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, or any of the other rights guaranteed by the Constitution are to be abridged, they must ne done so by legal means, i.e. constitutional amendment.

3	8143	9105	33	1	1	4	185	1	Instead, the benefit of defensive gun ownership that would be parallel to innocent lives lost to guns would be innocent lives saved by defensive use of guns.

2	9803	7815	13	14	1	7	3	1	All that I point out is that Canada, which has very strict gun control laws, also has a much lower murder rate than does the USA.	In fact, in kanada, suicides increased with stricter gun laws...another failed experiment.
2.333333333	1131	1131	47	89	1	5	5	1	You propose to abolish gun free zones, and allow people to carry guns into schools.	Making a gun free zone does nothing to prevent guns from entering it.

So now you're saying that just because somebody owns a gun, they're somehow more likely to start killing people than somebody who doesn't own a gun?
1	673	8368	1	25	1	5	0	1	The only time in my life I have seen someone who owned a gun use it against some one they got into an argument with was when that person was under the influence of drugs and alcohol.	The only way the person would get the gun back is if the person was found not guilty.

Guns are dangerous even though when they are banned people will still make them people think that they will still use them less people will use them less deaths will be by guns.
1	10199	673	1	1	1	79	3	1	Ok, so are the gun haters claiming the police department are giving the guns criminals use for crime back to the criminals?	This broader definition is used to cover general crimes committed with firearms (like possession by felons, armed career criminal violations, etc.)

3	38588	2417	4	72	3	4	2	1	Which is why the ban is a bit of a poor compromise, they've banned guns for law abiding people but they've not done enough to make sure criminals don't have them.	I see, so banning guns just stops law abiding citizens from having them, yet your family of criminals buys them from people who legally obtained them, or has them legally obtained for them.
1.333333333	1073	674	6	7	1	0	9	1	Gun hater pilot logic is for companies and governments to deny a person the right to bears arms to defend ones self then not be held responsible when these companies and governments fail to protect the unarmed citizens!

To support this open carry ban, you have argued that no right exists to carry a loaded handgun outside the home���making them useless and therefore the ban is just sweeping up the crumbs.

It is legal to own weapons in this country, they are just tightly controlled, and as a result we have far less gun crime (particularly where it's not related to organised crime).
1	7780	9037	161	222	1	4	102	1	Presumably, the cops knew if there was a gun in the homicide house since they searched it (even if it was not used in the homicide.)	That includes populations, gun homicides, non gun homicides and households with weapons in them.

1.333333333	7991	9059	10	176	1	7	1	1	So...you want laws dictating everything we can do with a gun...but when the laws spell out that we can't drink while armed, you're claiming that nobody will obey the law and drink anyway?	Are you saying that the only reason there are criminals armed with guns is because we're not willing to accept gun prohibitions as the answer?
1.333333333	10145	8654	72	20	1	17	1	1	Machine guns are not in common use so I see no reason to believe restrictions on them would be lifted based on the ruling.	They never said anything about allowing bans on commonly owned firearms, or ammunition, or allowing for heinous restrictions that wouldn't be considered constitutional when applied to other rights.
1	10057	7840	111	10	1	24	1	1	Civilians with other types of gun should be shot on sight by them.	The crime comes from using the gun (or any other weapon) to violate the rights of others.

3.333333333	1131	1131	37	42	1	0	1	1	Unarmed law-abiding citizens are victims of gun crimes because criminals do not obey the gun ban in that gun free zone.	Gun free zones are areas where law-abiding citizens are forbidden to carry guns.
1.333333333	8231	476	33	15	1	14	2	1	Before the Brady Law any criminal could walk into a gun store and easily purchase a gun.	That pretty much boiled down to laws against felons having weapons, laws against the mentally defective having weapons, and laws against carrying weapons in sensitive places.
1.666666667	9037	546	33	96	1	8	2	1	Therefore, we should not allow anyone to carry a gun on a plane, because these people may either be law abiding or not.

Or that the Second Amendment only keeps the federal government from passing new gun control laws?
3	8636	8891	60	2	1	6	14	1	Private citizens can never hope to acquire firearms when gun control laws exist, but all 'criminals' have instant connections to black-market arms dealers.	The legal market for firearms gets killed off in hopes of hindering criminals, and instead the criminals continue buying from the black market, importing them illegally, or making their weapons themselves.
1.333333333	10098	28080	376	40	1	12	4	3	Gun ban = No civilians can protect themselves using a firearm = Criminals can illegally purchase guns, like tons already do.	Illegal firearms can be identified and linked to other firearms and to crimes and criminals.
4	1103	296	30	102	1	4	2	1	Criminals that do not obey gun control laws will be able to obtain guns and use them on the unarmed law-abiding citizens.	Gun control laws do not stop criminals from getting guns.
2	10735	9099	77	102	1	4	1	1	Where is the evidence to prove that a person with a concealed carry permit is going to actually commit violent acts against another?	Furthermore there is nothing that would conclusively suggest denying this individual a concealed carry permit would have prevented the shooting from occurring.
1	623	657	31	46	1	9	10	1	Simple if gun haters want people defending the right to bear arms to be in militias, why would you want the militias to have lesser weapons then the enemies they are defending against?	Gun hater pilot will then say why do you need to target shoot if you no longer need guns to hunt or defend yourself?
1	534	10098	64	376	1	7	12	1	Illegal firearms can be identified and linked to other firearms and to crimes and criminals.	A criminal with a gun will feel a lot more confident in committing a crime than a criminal without a gun will just as a criminal will avoid those who have guns and target those who don't.
1.666666667	970	546	24	187	2	1	14	1	I also say that when people commit a crime with a gun these people need to be punished not the law-abiding citizens!	I like guns as much as the normal person does but if guns are abused by people, we need restictions.
1.666666667	1300	7840	6	3	1	5	9	1	That will take the criminals off the street and with them off the street there are no gun control concerns.	"Most of the ""gun control"" laws we have in the US have no potential to impact crime at all, except perhaps making the streets safer for criminals who have an unarmed public to prey upon."
1	7651	1378	130	18	1	4	3	1	If it was just a gun thing then they could go from internation flights from countries with no guns, but it isn't.	Gun owners don't drive into crowds of people simply because they had a gun in their car.
1	28080	8858	215	247	3	0	13	1	If so, they need to explain why they would leave some firearms, handguns say, in the hands of the people which are involved in more officer deaths than the ones they recommend banning.	Guns are dangerous even though when they are banned people will still make them people think that they will still use them less people will use them less deaths will be by guns.
1.333333333	546	179	153	4	1	17	0	1	I think law abiding citizens should be allowed to carry conceled weapons.	I think the government has taken responsibility for the law abiding citizens by ensuring that nobody can carry a gun or other dangerous weapon on board a plane.
3	8089	25130	15	16	1	9	5	3	You didn't address that since we have started adding more and more gun control that violent crimes have gone up and how even though America is #1 in gun ownership it tanks only 107th in homicide rates.	You're the one who has to explain why the US crime rates are so high when other countries manage to have guns and not go nuts.
2	37757	37823	19	70	3	0	3	3	How can a people defend themselves from the government, unless they are able to maintain the same weapons as the government has?	Those are all the government, if it has gotten as far as the people, and the government (the president, the congress, the supreme court) has decided on gun control, who's going to arrest them for it?
1.666666667	25130	2417	34	17	3	15	9	1	The vast majority of gun crimes do not end in a death.	However, even though there were less deaths, there was a surge in gun crime, death and non-death related, after the ban on guns.
1.333333333	8092	173	6	98	3	2	4	1	Gun haters are like the dangerous criminals the gun haters want to keep guns away from.	now imagine if no criminals could get hold of a gun, you wouldn't need a protection, as no criminals have guns.
2.333333333	9320	8858	98	188	1	6	8	1	A much higher gun ownership rate than other developed nations could explain this- that although crime occurs less frequently in the US crime is more likely to involve guns in the US so someone is more likely to die.	My point was that the theory that more gun control leaves people defenseless does not explain the lower murder rates in other developed nations.
4	28080	28080	611	234	3	2	14	3	Guns don't kill people, people kill people: absolutely true, but guns allow people to kill people with greater efficiency, which is not necessarily a good thing outside of the battlefield.	Whilst true that guns do not kill people, they provide those with the ability to kill.
1	28080	10759	215	58	3	0	4	1	Furthermore, the Founders envisioned people being armed with much less powerful weapons when they wrote the Second Amendment.	Guns are dangerous even though when they are banned people will still make them people think that they will still use them less people will use them less deaths will be by guns.
3	9100	5818	1	1	1	4	5	1	Many thousands of Guns are stolen and used in GUN CREATED CRIME because most legal gun owners	An expert on crime gun patterns, ATF agent Jay Wachtel says that most guns used in crimes are not stolen out of private gun owners' homes and cars.
1.333333333	10564	991	2	6	1	7	3	2	Many people who would never dream of shooting a person can own a gun simply for the artistry of a well made machine, people hunt with guns as well.	However, in doing so, people also found out that the AR series were more accurate for hunting and target shooting, and a much more reliable design than previous hunting rifles.
4	296	2417	102	65	1	2	1	1	Gun control laws do not deprive gun ownership for those who do not follow laws.	Criminals that do not obey gun control laws will be able to obtain guns and use them on the unarmed law-abiding citizens.
3	339	339	61	63	1	13	18	1	"Again, the decisions I'm referring to as ""activist"" are those that are granting powers to the government that are not enumerated."	What I mentioned about the liberals refers only to government powers not granted by the constitution.
1.666666667	10371	25798	8	91	1	0	3	3	Their argument is hardly valid, they want to stop the selling of firearms to people because they think it will decrease the crimes and school shootings along with other dangers that are caused by guns.	The argument isn't that guns promote or cause crime, it is that when crimes happen having a gun involved causes more damage.
4	1194	1194	19	3	1	3	14	1	I think laws stating that you should not be allowed to carry guns onto airplanes or into schools are examples of common sense gun control laws meant to protect people.	I only support common sense gun control measures, thing such as no guns in schools, no guns on airplanes, background checks for the sale of all firearms, tougher sentences for crimes in which guns are used, etc.
1	10011	673	48	1	1	0	5	1	The only way the person would get the gun back is if the person was found not guilty.	How many crimes are prevented each day because of the mere presence of a gun or even the suspicion that the victim or someone near by has a gun?
3.333333333	1078	991	1	15	1	53	0	2	Yeah, thing is that the second ammendment makes the point that guns should be allowed because a _well organised militia_ is an important tool for a nation.	Gun prohibitionists argue that the Second Amendment confers a right to bear arms only on duly enrolled members of a state militia.
1	18549	9211	48	51	3	0	40	1	Sticks and stones, lions and spears, swords, telephone cords, screwdrivers, cannons, canyons, burning them alive, cement shoes, pillows, pens, guns... The methods may change, but the fact remains - some people will kill, (or harm) other people.	The number of guns owned by civilians is around 25 million, or 30.3 firearms per 100 people.
3.333333333	669	9320	46	96	1	10	6	1	Yes, that must be the reason why in other developed nations where there are more restrictions on guns less defenseless people are being murdered by criminals.	The reality is that in developed nations with stricter gun laws than the US there are less outlaws owning and using guns.
1.666666667	8182	8829	287	58	1	18	7	1	Extremist is rejecting any notion of firearm ownership or of reasonable gun control.	And that assumes that gun control will have no effect on illegal firearm ownership.

3.666666667	560	674	30	5	1	13	21	1	Gun haters are the extremist hate group demanding to ban the right to bear arms!	Gun haters must attack people defending the right to bear arms by calling them fanatics.
3.333333333	10680	10680	6	14	1	1	6	1	There has been no legitimate study presented to show that those who own firearms are more likely to engage in binge drinking than any other person.	Those who admit to being a firearms owner are unlikely to admit to binge drinking, and those who admit they engage in binge drinking are unlikely to admit to owning a firearm.
2.666666667	185	11417	26	1	1	8	1	3	Some studies used against gun have been ones showing that over 50% of homicides in the US are committed with guns, while in countries with gun bans or very strict gun control have a lower amount of gun homicides.	If gun bans worked there would be no gun deaths in the countries that have banned guns.
1	667	673	3	1	1	13	3	1	Ok, so are the gun haters claiming the police department are giving the guns criminals use for crime back to the criminals?	Gun hater Sarah Brady like al gun hater blame the right to bear arms for the crimes committed with guns.

1.666666667	9009	10199	95	64	1	9	2	1	If you want any protection for your rights, you have to be able to present an argument outlining how they are being violated.	You still have to prove that gun control equals crime control and your admission that it does not is proof that it is about control and dependency on government to protect you when they have no obligation to do so.
1	1103	640	25	9	1	0	1	1	Your advocating total violation of the constitution to prevent criminals from stealing guns from law abiding citizens.	This is just as unrealistic a view that saying gun laws will prevent all crime- of course some criminals will not obey the law- that is what makes them criminals!
2.333333333	2927	9496	12	61	1	28	1	1	If the Second Amendment doesn't apply to the states then there is no Second Amendment legal protection against state gun laws (which would include any state laws that ban guns in school areas).	Unless the second amendment is recognised as an individual right, and given the full protection of law as other rights are, there is nothing to say that a law could not be passed tomorrow banning all weapons in this country.
2.333333333	8478	969	11	11	1	7	17	1	2) ensure that the right to keep and bear arms for a militia is not infringed.	It's quite obvious by this and as well as the SCOTUS decision that the right to keep and bear arms is not dependent on the militia part, but the other way around.

3.666666667	25130	2357	82	18	3	8	6	1	Law abiding citizens obey the law, there can surely be no reason to prohibit them form having guns.	Gun laws and bans are put in place that only affect good law abiding free citizens.
4.666666667	1131	1131	28	100	1	1	0	1	Criminals do not obey the laws about gun free zones.	Gun free zones are zones where criminals will have guns because criminals will not obey the laws about gun free zones.
2.666666667	4813	9919	8	1	1	5	26	1	Handguns and assault weapons are explicitly protected by the 2nd Amendment because they are needed to fight against a tyrannical government, but tanks, fighter aircraft, helicopter gunships, and nuclear weapons are not protected for some reason.

Also if both points are true, would you sacrifice you right to protect your rights with guns (rather than politically) for a crime rate low enough where you don't feel you need a gun for protection?

2	6116	5376	16	1	1	6	4	1	I think we recognize that gun control laws can reduce the number of criminals owning guns although not disarm every criminal.	For instance I don't think that eliminating gun control is the only answer crime control is also needed.
1	8777	28080	97	190	1	1	3	3	It is just a case of prevention, remove guns being so easily accessible and you then decrease the gun crime and remove the need for guns to defend yourself.	You've made the argument that registration of firearms is perfectly legal and constitutional, despite the fact that the Firearm Owners Protection Act forbids any and all type of database of guns or gun owners.

I could easily point out how many people are killed by criminals because they aren't armed and able to fight back, and that could be seen as grounds for removing the restrictive gun laws we have in this country.
2.666666667	8858	2927	3	72	1	29	3	1	Because many people have interpreted the 2nd amendment as an individual right, the states have lost their militas.	Some advocate banning Assault Weapons, and you yourself have put forth several arguments that the 2nd amendment is not an Individual Right, and it applies only to a states right to form a militia.

1.666666667	339	28080	63	415	1	24	4	3	Something else you must keep in mind is that if we outlaw guns, the only people with guns will be outlaws, this leaves no defense for law abiding citizens.	Law abiding citizens are not going to misuse their firearms and those with criminal records are already banned from owning guns.
2.333333333	4400	4400	154	124	1	2	5	1	With gun control, murders will probably go down just a little, but violent crimes, such as Rape, sexual assult etc, robbery, burglary, and assult will skyrocket.

1	1115	9259	1	15	1	11	0	1	No, but they might like to challenge the conclusion that states with less strict firearm laws are more often the source of guns used in crimes, in other states, than guns from states with stricter gun laws.	Similarly, a company will still face civil liability in addition to criminal penalties if it has violated state or federal law or sold a gun knowing that it would be used to commit a crime.
3.333333333	296	546	62	101	1	5	3	1	Notice not one of the common sense gun control laws gun hater pilot is demanding is to punish dangerous criminals by keeping them in prison to keep guns away from them!

2.333333333	4400	10371	15	8	1	2	12	1	Right now we have the worst of both strategies, gun laws are restrictive enough that not many criminals are being stopped by citizens; they are permissive enough that low level criminals may still own a gun legally.	It is not the legal gun doing the crime it is the illegaly owned guns, so if you take my guns the criminals have no one to stop them since they have guns we don't.

1	534	8543	64	13	1	7	10	1	I do not believe OTHERS should not have guns, I think criminals and psychos who are yet to convict a gun crime should not have guns.	A criminal with a gun will feel a lot more confident in committing a crime than a criminal without a gun will just as a criminal will avoid those who have guns and target those who don't.

3.666666667	7602	8543	15	71	1	1	4	1	"Therefore, the clichet term ""if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns"" comes into play."	The criminals already have plenty of guns, that means that ending gun ownership will play no real part in ending gun possession by criminals.
1.333333333	6116	4851	12	7	1	1	5	1	Having an age limit on the ability to buy guns is a gun control measure.	The homicide rate has climbed drasticaly with every gun control measure.

1.666666667	10662	48	22	50	1	16	6	1	It was felt by many (not all) at the time that such weapons were not military weapons and thus did not fall under the protection of the Second Amendment or the right to bear arms in their own state constitutions.	"Government does not possess the authority to enact a total ban on firearm owners actually transporting their firearms, it violates the ""bear"" of the ""keep and bear"" provision of the second amendment."
2	7840	10713	37	20	1	4	12	1	Like I said before, claiming that semi-automatic rifles get a lower level of constitutional protection than handguns because they are less useful for self defense seems absurd from historical point of view.	This appeared to me to be an argument that self defense cannot exist if a gun is used.
3.333333333	969	764	12	36	1	6	6	1	This makes sense when you consider that the second amendment protects the right of the people to bear arms in connection with an organized militia.	Even if today's well-regulated militia were the National Guard, the Second Amendment still protects an individual right to keep and bear arms.
2.333333333	296	9803	62	21	1	5	1	1	WE AGREE THAT CRIMINALS SHOULDN'T BE ARMED, and the laws already exist on the books to punish them when convicted criminals are caught with guns.

1.666666667	970	18549	24	40	2	1	13	3	I like how anti gun people say we need to protect everyone from the rare gun events by banning guns, but when someone suggests banning the more frequent hammer and club attacks, they can justify those deaths.	I like guns as much as the normal person does but if guns are abused by people, we need restictions.

So now you're saying that just because somebody owns a gun, they're somehow more likely to start killing people than somebody who doesn't own a gun?
1.333333333	12892	4012	1	6	3	0	14	1	It wouldn't protect the guns owned at the home of someone in the National Guard.]	Well, owning handguns for personal home protection is different that carrying guns in a concealed fashion for protection.
3.333333333	1660	2606	29	2	1	16	2	1	In the Miller case, the court essentially ruled that the second ammendment does indeed convey an individual right, but that the right in question is dependant on the type of weapon (i.e must be suitable for military use).	In other words the Miller case interpreted the Second Amendment to mean one has the right to own militia type weapons.
1.333333333	9507	7507	44	8	1	1	1	1	I think it is interesting that gun nuts always claim that when guns are banned people will just use knives instead, yet we find that with guns prohibited there are still only 200 deaths a year from knife like weapons.	I implied that there are people with guns that are nuts, not that all gun owners are nuts...
1	7840	1168	10	32	1	1	3	1	The gun rights advocates I know are generally not like this, they support rights regardless if whther they agree with how they are being practiced or not.	Civilians with other types of gun should be shot on sight by them.

3.666666667	28080	764	177	122	3	4	20	1	We may therefore conclude that, any reason or purpose for an individual owning a gun, OTHER THAN for a militia, is not provided for under the 2nd Amendment, and that current gun laws for private ownership of guns is mistaken.	The second amendment says MILITIAS have the right to carry guns, not private citizens, and that is why the militias are there to protects us and are composed of....private citizens.

First you say no law will ever stop criminals from getting guns but now youre saying that criminals are never gun owners.

3.666666667	28080	8636	115	60	3	1	6	1	The legal market for firearms gets killed off in hopes of hindering criminals, and instead the criminals continue buying from the black market, importing them illegally, or making their weapons themselves.	Crime rates equals criminals which means if guns are illegal, they must be getting them from somewhere, hmmm, i wonder where, black market or illegal selling across borders anyone?
1	10003	9320	27	96	1	8	6	1	Yes, that must be the reason why in other developed nations where there are more restrictions on guns less defenseless people are being murdered by criminals.	Some people will argue that there should be little or no gun regulation, while others will argue that there should be as much regulation as the courts will allow.
2.333333333	8636	4400	72	26	1	18	8	1	Gun control in the U.S. does not equal crime control.	Doesn't hold together, though - you have no evidence that criminal arms supply is unaffected by gun control.
1	4001	25798	29	91	1	2	3	3	Their argument is hardly valid, they want to stop the selling of firearms to people because they think it will decrease the crimes and school shootings along with other dangers that are caused by guns.	What I wonder is, if citizens/subjects are supposed to defend themselves with their bare hands (because guns are heavily regulated and knives are next ) why do police need to shoot people to stop them from causing harm?
3	28080	6753	581	71	3	6	2	1	You somehow seem to think that getting rid of guns will stop people from killing each other.	it isn't guns that kill people, is the mentality these people carry around in their heads that kill other people.
3	9330	9321	9	1	1	17	12	1	Two weeks ago, concerning a case out of Chicago, the justices agreed to rule on whether the Second Amendment gives Americans a constitutional right to keep and bear arms that is enforceable against local and state gun laws.	The Second Amendment confers the right to bear arms, and earlier this year a U.S. Supreme Court ruling curtailed government's ability to regulate guns.
1	7991	8065	10	92	1	7	1	1	It doesnt say you have the right to shoot arms so it would be okay to ban bullets.	Are you saying that the only reason there are criminals armed with guns is because we're not willing to accept gun prohibitions as the answer?
3.333333333	6455	7704	65	88	1	0	1	1	"The prefatory phrase is a rationale for the non-infringement of the right of the people to keep and bear arms, however the prefatory phrase does NOT qualify ""the right"" or ""the people""."	"Please explain further how ""to keep and bear arms"" is a qualifier on ""the people""."
4	667	623	3	30	1	15	15	1	The only problem with gun hater pilot�۪s common sense bs is that the dangerous criminals these laws are meant to keep guns away from do not obey gun control laws!	Common sense gun control laws the gun haters want will only affect the law abiding citizens, not the criminals.
1	1194	534	3	95	1	14	4	1	If that means gun control then so be it, but it does not.	I think laws stating that you should not be allowed to carry guns onto airplanes or into schools are examples of common sense gun control laws meant to protect people.
2.666666667	7967	8182	33	74	1	5	3	1	If a gun used to commit crimes isn't found in the registry, then the registry isn't much of a valuable crime fighting tool is it?	If a registered gun owner uses his gun to commit a crime, (besides running the risk of threatening armed citizens) he would be easily tracked down and apprehended.
2.333333333	28080	8660	297	6	3	0	4	1	Once we disarm law abiding citizens, the only armed civilians around will be criminals who would never willingly give up their weapons.	If today we were to ban guns all the law abiding citizens would give up their firearms and protection.
1	6753	4813	138	3	1	6	2	1	I think a better debate would be when should gun control start?	Although I still think that certain regulations need to be set in place in order to control the distribution of guns, complete gun control is not the answer; however, something still needs to be done.
2.333333333	6509	28080	28	197	1	0	5	3	Reports show that a small percentage of gun owners actually use a gun to defend themselves, there are more killed with a gun, than those using a gun to protect themselves, they cain't say it's used for selfdefense.	The claim by the anti gun lobby that guns are used more often in crime than in self defence is and old one.
1.333333333	5376	1284	2	27	1	8	2	1	While Americans have a relatively high per-capita rate of firearms ownership the vast majority of those guns stay in citizen's homes.	The higher rate of gun ownership by criminals is far outweighed by the threat of citizens owning guns.
1.666666667	9636	8858	31	211	1	2	6	1	You say that gun control must not be effective because the study's conclusions about gun control were inconclusive.	Simply put, you should have to prove that the gun control you seek will do what you say it will do before burdening the Constitution with a load up of Liberal wishes and hopes!
1.666666667	4400	28080	5	581	1	4	6	3	it isn't guns that kill people, is the mentality these people carry around in their heads that kill other people.	In short, Norway has more guns, yet less people killing each other.
3	296	1131	64	28	1	5	0	1	Gun free zones are zones where law-abiding citizens are forbidden to have guns because law-abiding citizens obey the law about gun free zones.	Gun bans simple ban law abiding citizens from having guns.
1	37757	8777	34	97	3	1	1	1	You've made the argument that registration of firearms is perfectly legal and constitutional, despite the fact that the Firearm Owners Protection Act forbids any and all type of database of guns or gun owners.	And it is legal to ban marijuana and cigarets but guns are protected by the constitution.
1.666666667	9009	9009	48	36	1	6	2	1	It took the 14th amendment for them to get the right to keep and bear arms and still today the gun grabber agenda is based on denial of rights, all rights and not just Second Amendment rights.	They did so on the basis that blacks were not citizens, and thus did not have the same rights, including the right to keep and bear arms protected in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as whites.
1.666666667	640	12361	9	76	1	1	3	3	This should be a clear indicator that legal ownership of guns in no way has increased potential criminality for law abiding citizens.	Your advocating total violation of the constitution to prevent criminals from stealing guns from law abiding citizens.
1.666666667	7991	8543	8	117	1	4	10	1	Banning guns will not ban the threat of criminal violence it will just make the law abiding subject to the will and whim of the stronger thugs	Keeping violent criminals in prison would do far more to reduce gun crime than banning guns.
1	37823	975	70	21	3	3	3	1	Now that said, one has to wonder why people for gun control or anti gun types keep telling people that defend the right to bear arms that they could not win a fight.	How can a people defend themselves from the government, unless they are able to maintain the same weapons as the government has?
1	9394	669	94	41	1	0	2	1	If you need guns to ensure that your government doesn't become corrupt or tyranical you wouldn't want them to know where the guns are, would you?	To generalize gun owners in this way must mean you're either a complete dick or that your government likes to keep you ignorant.
1	9095	9738	1	35	1	11	12	1	On average, the states that have done the most to regulate private gun sales appear to have lower firearm death rates and lower firearm homicide rates.	Within the United States, rural areas have higher rates of gun ownership and lower rates of murder, whites have higher rates of gun ownership than blacks and much lower murder rates.
2.666666667	10199	7543	23	30	1	5	0	3	It's pointless people with criminal backgrounds aren't buying guns from gun stores (all of which already run background checks) there are no background checks on the black market and laws won't change that.	If somebody fails the background check they go buy a gun elsewhere.
2	546	9394	191	181	1	9	17	1	The argument of Lautenberg and others is that if somebody is deemed too dangerous or suspicious to board an airplane, they shouldn't be permitted to buy a weapon.	Felons are not allowed to buy guns.....terrorists would not be allowed to take guns on planes.
1.333333333	8541	9320	10	77	1	128	5	1	The gun show review found that firearms were diverted at and through gun shows by straw purchasers, unregulated private sellers, and licensed dealers.	buying guns, there is no requirement that federally licensed gun manufacturers and dealers
3.333333333	28080	9270	57	74	3	2	10	1	Sure you say guns don't kill people but people kill people, but the gun is only a tool or a means to that end.	sure you can kill with other things, but most homicide weapons are guns.
3	9191	623	19	75	1	2	15	1	Gun hater pilot's lack of logic is to not allow law abding citizens the right to bear arms, and do nothing to protect the unarmed law abiding citizens.	The logic of less guns in law abiding citizens hands means less gun crime is clearly insane.
2.333333333	991	9919	5	1	2	0	56	1	I believe in gun control (and wrote this piece to satirize pro-gunners) because I hate guns and want to see them all banned, which is why I own guns and also enjoy reading firearms-related literature.	I don't believe guns are good for anything, and I see no use in having them, but I believe it is everybody's right to produce or keep one, as it is just a weapon like anything else.
1.333333333	2280	8391	5	12	2	5	2	1	Private ownership of guns may indeed add to the number of weapons held by criminals, but it is not their major source of weapons.	While their by no means should be an outlaw of guns, I do believe restrictions should be put in place.
2	6753	6116	138	16	1	6	6	1	For instance I don't think that eliminating gun control is the only answer crime control is also needed.	Although I still think that certain regulations need to be set in place in order to control the distribution of guns, complete gun control is not the answer; however, something still needs to be done.
2.333333333	2417	25130	58	82	1	6	13	3	where gun control laws prohibit good law abiding citizens from carrying a gun to protect themselves and others.	We could hypothesize that if guns are banned then law abiding citizens who usually didn't carry or own guns before the ban will be less likely to face armed opponents.
1	36399	10352	24	28	3	2	3	1	So if its cause people in high crime areas want to buy guns for protection then why do they only want protection against gun murders but not other crimes.	if one wants to own a gun i have no qualms with them but if they wish to own guns such as a AK47 and AK74u they should be dealt with in a more civilized manner to protect the people.
2.666666667	10547	9601	36	14	1	3	6	1	All that does is imply that crime rate depends on more than just the presence/absence of guns - it disproves 'more guns = more crime' about as much as it disproves 'more guns = less crime'.	And because as he so convincingly puts it : MORE GUNS= LESS CRIME
1	10622	10662	121	81	1	2	0	1	I think the precedent set by Heller was that the Second Amendment protects an individual right but judges can still do the mental gymnastics to justify the gun control laws they like.	One private individual asking another if they have guns in the home and then offering them a pamphlet on firearms safety if they say yes has nothing at all to do with gun control or the second amendment.
2.666666667	1660	764	77	122	1	4	12	1	The 2nd Amendment does NOT provide an individual the Right to own gun(s) for the PURPOSE OF providing for: food, self-defense, target practice, a hobby as a collector, or fun.	The 2nd Amendment gives citizens the rights to own a gun, not the Militia Act.
3.666666667	969	2280	12	22	1	6	0	2	THE SECOND AMENDMENT- A well regulated militia,being necessary to the security of a free state,the right of the people to keep and bear arms,shall not be infringed.PERIOD.	Even if today's well-regulated militia were the National Guard, the Second Amendment still protects an individual right to keep and bear arms.
3.333333333	4400	10817	390	43	1	3	118	1	Amendment militia preamble is no different: ���A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state�۝���a state in which the citizen need not fear the ambitions of a would-be military tyrant at the head of a standing army.	The Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States America states that, ���A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.�۝
2	10098	10060	170	82	1	2	21	1	The 2nd Amendment is not there to entitle you to all of the gun control you want!	Now when you rightfully talk about how the 2nd amendment grants me the right to own a gun people won't take you seriously because you think the 2nd amendment cannot be repealed.
1.333333333	8048	10149	20	26	1	1	77	1	This they cannot do without abandoning the more guns = more crime myth.	If guns are banned, the only people who will surrender them are those who commit nearly no gun crime at all.
1.333333333	1194	10783	3	47	1	14	1	1	In some states, some guns are just not allowed and it sticks as a law.	I think laws stating that you should not be allowed to carry guns onto airplanes or into schools are examples of common sense gun control laws meant to protect people.
2.333333333	9100	8541	1	10	1	22	128	1	buying guns, there is no requirement that federally licensed gun manufacturers and dealers	Another large source of guns used in crimes are unlicensed street dealers who either get their guns through illegal transactions with licensed dealers, straw purchases, or from gun thefts.
2.666666667	5767	953	8	6	1	2	9	1	And I don't think that the second amendment is a good argument against gun control since the federal courts have not recognized gun-control as being offensive to the second amendment.	I've been told by gun activists that the second amendment protects a limited right and therefore people can be banned from owning WMD's.
2.666666667	10199	953	260	6	1	6	9	1	And I don't think that the second amendment is a good argument against gun control since the federal courts have not recognized gun-control as being offensive to the second amendment.	What you've been doing isn't a debate about gun control, it's criticism of the Supreme Court for saying the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own a gun for legal purposes.
3.333333333	8541	8541	8	6	1	0	2	1	By that brand of logic, any gun law is specifically aimed at reducing criminal use of guns, including a complete ban.	NATO, Galileo has claimed that these laws are designed to reduce criminal use of guns (which would have to mean that they target the people, not the guns).
1.333333333	7840	8929	34	90	1	16	5	1	All of the Gun control you call for has been tried in other countries and the Criminals Still import guns in with their drugs.	Should guns be controlled, that would give people the right to demand that you surrender your weapons, just as the state currently demends that you hand over all terrorists, drugs and illegal material.
1	7929	673	95	1	1	0	3	1	Ok, so are the gun haters claiming the police department are giving the guns criminals use for crime back to the criminals?	A law-abiding gun nut who uses their gun in committing a crime, is a criminal, and not law-abiding.
1	10149	25130	113	34	1	17	32	3	One of the reason we are the country we are is because of our right to own guns.	"For every one crime gun that California exports, we get more than two crime guns imported back into our state."""
1	9054	9270	15	74	1	7	10	1	Sure you say guns don't kill people but people kill people, but the gun is only a tool or a means to that end.	If you believe what you say in:as it is presently, gun crimes still occur, people have their rights to own guns revoked on a case by case basis, and dying of gun shots is actually very rare.
1.333333333	10098	11028	170	212	1	2	4	1	What it seems like you are claiming is that if the owner would otherwise let you in if you didn't have a gun, you have a right to go in by the 2nd amendment.	Now when you rightfully talk about how the 2nd amendment grants me the right to own a gun people won't take you seriously because you think the 2nd amendment cannot be repealed.
1.666666667	10098	991	104	6	1	39	3	2	Many people who would never dream of shooting a person can own a gun simply for the artistry of a well made machine, people hunt with guns as well.	People like Brady blame the gun and say because one man uses a gun to harm someone then no one can be trusted with guns.
4	173	339	72	75	1	12	2	1	Somebody challenged California's assault weapons ban and the court ruled the ban is not unconstitutional because there is no individual right to keep and bear arms.	In Silveira v. Lockyer the 9th Circuit Court ruled that California's Assault Weapons Control Act is not unconstitutional and that the second amendment does not protect an individual right.
1	10912	4400	3	154	1	1	2	1	Muggings, burglaries, rapes, assault and battery are all examples of violent crimes that don't require a gun.	None are so fearful as those who need to have guns and more guns and more guns and more and more ammo, and assault weapons.
2.666666667	8770	1131	18	89	1	2	5	1	You propose to abolish gun free zones, and allow people to carry guns into schools.	Innocent people were butchered where no guns were permitted, while nobody is being shot full of holes in the schools where carrying a gun is permitted.
4	8182	7602	287	15	1	18	1	1	The criminals already have plenty of guns, that means that ending gun ownership will play no real part in ending gun possession by criminals.	And that assumes that gun control will have no effect on illegal firearm ownership.
1	28080	4400	150	154	3	1	2	1	Muggings, burglaries, rapes, assault and battery are all examples of violent crimes that don't require a gun.	with regard to the fact that most gun crime is from illegl guns, in that case why not make all guns illegal.
0.666666667	9600	10011	48	240	1	8	4	1	We have a right to use a gun to defend ourselves and others.	Right now all the police can do is try and match bullets against other bullets in an attempt to determine which gun was used.
1.666666667	36399	657	24	46	3	2	10	1	Simple if gun haters want people defending the right to bear arms to be in militias, why would you want the militias to have lesser weapons then the enemies they are defending against?	if one wants to own a gun i have no qualms with them but if they wish to own guns such as a AK47 and AK74u they should be dealt with in a more civilized manner to protect the people.
3	4400	9601	10	14	1	2	6	1	All that does is imply that crime rate depends on more than just the presence/absence of guns - it disproves 'more guns = more crime' about as much as it disproves 'more guns = less crime'.	All one can reasonably conclude is that more firearms does not increase the homicide rate, nor does less guns reduce it.
2.666666667	8089	9320	15	98	1	9	6	1	My point was that the theory that more gun control leaves people defenseless does not explain the lower murder rates in other developed nations.	You're the one who has to explain why the US crime rates are so high when other countries manage to have guns and not go nuts.
1.666666667	9054	5977	1	14	1	5	3	1	We currently have more guns per capita than we have at any time since the 1920's, and crime continues to decline.	Perhaps if other types of firearms were as strictly regulated as machine guns are then we could make some real progress in reducing gun violence and murder.
2.666666667	6116	7815	12	14	1	1	3	1	All that I point out is that Canada, which has very strict gun control laws, also has a much lower murder rate than does the USA.	The homicide rate has climbed drasticaly with every gun control measure.
2	9037	7991	261	8	1	67	4	1	Keeping violent criminals in prison would do far more to reduce gun crime than banning guns.	If more guns present means that more criminals will be able to commit more killings and violent criminals, wouldn't they have allowed the ban to remain in place?
1.666666667	185	8541	25	6	1	1	2	1	By that brand of logic, any gun law is specifically aimed at reducing criminal use of guns, including a complete ban.	You can not use this as evidence that the reduction in crime is due to the gun ban.
1	7840	764	37	187	1	4	5	1	I am, however, suprised that gun rights advocates use this case to defend the right to own guns, because the case seems to imply the opposite, as stated by Tim.	This appeared to me to be an argument that self defense cannot exist if a gun is used.
2.666666667	10622	1145	121	1	1	2	8	1	The gun right people demand that they be allowed to hand out pamphlets defending the right to have guns if the school allowed anti gun/gun control advocates to pass out pamphlets vilifying guns.	One private individual asking another if they have guns in the home and then offering them a pamphlet on firearms safety if they say yes has nothing at all to do with gun control or the second amendment.
3.333333333	1131	1131	90	47	1	4	5	1	Making a gun free zone does nothing to prevent guns from entering it.	All gun free zones can do, is keep law-abiding citizens from having guns.
2.333333333	9841	48	34	50	1	13	6	1	It was felt by many (not all) at the time that such weapons were not military weapons and thus did not fall under the protection of the Second Amendment or the right to bear arms in their own state constitutions.	Amendment protects the right of the states to arm their militias.
1	9054	9259	7	15	1	3	0	1	No, but they might like to challenge the conclusion that states with less strict firearm laws are more often the source of guns used in crimes, in other states, than guns from states with stricter gun laws.	Perhaps if other types of firearms were as strictly regulated as machine guns
3.333333333	8048	20890	20	24	1	1	0	3	If guns are banned, the only people that will be affected will be the people that buy guns for protection from criminals, who get their guns illegally anyway.	If guns are banned, the only people who will surrender them are those who commit nearly no gun crime at all.
1	8284	546	44	275	1	3	5	1	I am not attacking anyone, I am just pointing out that if there were armed citizens on board, and again, we do not know if there were, they did not use their guns.	I could easily point out how many people are killed by criminals because they aren't armed and able to fight back, and that could be seen as grounds for removing the restrictive gun laws we have in this country.
1	10735	10352	35	28	1	15	3	1	So if its cause people in high crime areas want to buy guns for protection then why do they only want protection against gun murders but not other crimes.	There is no reason why gun owners should have to pay taxes to support police protection for people not wanting to own guns.
2	9636	10330	128	26	1	59	36	1	The right to keep and bear arms is an inalienable right, it is not a policy decision nor a political decision, it is an enumerated RIGHT against all positive forms of government and retained by the people.	The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.
1.666666667	546	623	101	29	1	3	7	1	But gun hater pilot will demand that the right to bear arms be limited or banned to keep criminals from getting guns.	Notice not one of the common sense gun control laws gun hater pilot is demanding is to punish dangerous criminals by keeping them in prison to keep guns away from them!
4	1131	1131	37	28	1	0	0	1	Gun free zones are zones where law-abiding citizens are forbidden to have guns because law-abiding citizens obey the law about gun free zones.	Gun free zones are areas where law-abiding citizens are forbidden to carry guns.
1	8035	7780	47	112	1	1	1	1	Burglars do not use guns, muggers do not use guns.	Gun ownership is a protected right, and the fact that criminals use guns in the commission of crime will never change this fact.
1.333333333	8543	9496	13	18	1	10	0	1	I think some of the courts that have quoted that sentence from Heller to justify laws that ban felons from owning firearms would disagree.	I do not believe OTHERS should not have guns, I think criminals and psychos who are yet to convict a gun crime should not have guns.
3.333333333	6651	2417	7	65	1	68	1	1	Gun control laws do not deprive gun ownership for those who do not follow laws.	It is asserted, therefore, that the D.C. gun control laws irrationally prevent only law abiding citizens from owning handguns.
2.666666667	9270	4400	73	10	1	3	2	1	All one can reasonably conclude is that more firearms does not increase the homicide rate, nor does less guns reduce it.	The theory is that reducing the overall number of handguns will somehow reduce gun crime, which is a little like saying that reducing the overall number of cars will reduce drunk driving.
3	8860	25130	34	82	1	28	2	3	2nd amendment: A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE to keep and bear arms shall NOT be INFRINGED.	The 2nd Amendment was put in to stop your guys from infringing on our Right to Keep and Bear Arms!

The first part indicates the importance of the militia, the second part illustrates that the people may be part of that well regulated body or not without infringement of their right to keep and bear arms.
2.333333333	10265	8035	79	69	1	9	0	1	I'm willing to bet that the main reason for America's crime rates is the fact that we have too much diversity in gun laws.	We already have more than enough gun Laws and Although I haven't personally checked the statistics I would be willing to bet that most of these Laws that were passed haven't made a big difference in stopping crimes.
1.666666667	10154	9054	35	19	1	10	12	1	The courts up to the supreme court have held that criminals can't be made to register guns.	You claimed that the Supreme Court gave the green light to all kinds of bans and restrictions on guns and ammunition, something that never took place.

2.333333333	9841	10041	34	28	1	13	26	1	Especially since one of your arguments is that the Second Amendment only protects arms suitable for militia duties, which would be all semi-automatic firearms in existence!	Amendment protects the right of the states to arm their militias.
3	2927	764	33	36	1	10	6	1	This makes sense when you consider that the second amendment protects the right of the people to bear arms in connection with an organized militia.	"Interesting how some people insist that the RKBA is not limited by the militia, but here you let ""arms"" in the second amendment be limited according to the militia."
1	25798	10352	91	28	3	3	3	1	So if its cause people in high crime areas want to buy guns for protection then why do they only want protection against gun murders but not other crimes.	Their argument is hardly valid, they want to stop the selling of firearms to people because they think it will decrease the crimes and school shootings along with other dangers that are caused by guns.
2.333333333	10199	10199	260	260	1	13	6	1	What you've been doing isn't a debate about gun control, it's criticism of the Supreme Court for saying the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own a gun for legal purposes.	"The Second Amendment was never about individual gun ownership, it's only purpose was proper case of a government organized and controlled militia."""
3.333333333	1067	28080	9	24	2	1	16	3	This 'flimsy' piece of paper guarantees our rights as citizens, it protects us from our own government and it protects us from foreign governments.	The founding fathers built the government so that it could not become so powerful as to strip us of our rights.

Some studies used against gun have been ones showing that over 50% of homicides in the US are committed with guns, while in countries with gun bans or very strict gun control have a lower amount of gun homicides.
2.333333333	2417	10395	26	11	1	1	5	1	Various groups have been unable to show that the criminal use of firearms leads to more deaths than the number of lives that are saved by private and legal gun ownership.	Both show numbers between societies with differing amounts of firearms ownership.

Do you understand that any proposed gun control law must pass the strict scrutiny test due to the Second Amendment being recognized as a fundamental right protected by the Constitution?
2.666666667	10121	2280	1	1	1	44	0	2	The right to bear arms is explicit and clear in the second amendment.	Of course, nothing in the text of the Second Amendment places location-based limits on the right to keep and bear arms.
1.333333333	10060	10098	82	234	1	21	0	1	Which would be worthless because you could just repeal that amendment and then repeal the 2nd.	The 2nd Amendment is not there to entitle you to all of the gun control you want!
5	10759	10570	58	3	1	4	1	1	Of course, when the founders wrote the Second Amendment they had in mind people owning much less powerful weapons than gun owners have now.	Furthermore, the Founders envisioned people being armed with much less powerful weapons when they wrote the Second Amendment.
3	8509	28080	1	190	1	1	3	3	It is just a case of prevention, remove guns being so easily accessible and you then decrease the gun crime and remove the need for guns to defend yourself.	Those who would remove our freedom to defend ourselves always seem to link the number of guns to the high rate of gun crime.
1	7815	10783	15	47	1	24	1	1	In some states, some guns are just not allowed and it sticks as a law.	To expect strict gun control laws to have any effect, in and of themselves, in a nation with 300,000,000 guns in private hands is ridiculous.

2.666666667	1073	10011	6	240	1	0	4	1	We have a right to use a gun to defend ourselves and others.	Is your point that citizens should be allowed to have guns to defend themselves from the government or that citizens should be allowed to have guns to protect themselves from other citizens?
1.666666667	6753	10351	138	11	1	6	1	1	So I think gun control on the magnitude you want would effect it, how could it not?	Although I still think that certain regulations need to be set in place in order to control the distribution of guns, complete gun control is not the answer; however, something still needs to be done.
1.333333333	185	36399	20	19	1	4	4	3	"Even ""If criminals keep their guns"",(if we were to confiscate all guns) "" they wont be able to use them."	They will not only confiscate the guns, but then charge the owners of those guns for being terrorists.

"Because the term ""gun nut"" has come to mean a disparaging remark about anybody that supports the individual rights interpretation of the Second Amendment, and favors gun ownership over gun bans."
1	296	37823	62	70	1	5	3	3	How can a people defend themselves from the government, unless they are able to maintain the same weapons as the government has?	People that defend the right to bear arms that demand laws that punish criminals by keeping them in prison thus keeping guns away from them.
1.333333333	9037	1073	142	6	1	9	0	1	Is your point that citizens should be allowed to have guns to defend themselves from the government or that citizens should be allowed to have guns to protect themselves from other citizens?	Neither you nor your side will admit that criminals use guns or other weapons to rob banks or citizens for money or other valuables to support their drug habits or other criminal achievements.
3	7651	296	155	4	1	1	2	1	Then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the US?	Prohibition led to an increase in organized crime, but that hasn't seemed to happen in nations that have banned guns.
1	10199	1543	28	108	1	15	2	1	Using a shotgun or an AK-47 will get the job done, so I don't see the need to ban assault weapons.	"I want to see, in the Constitution, where government has an affirmative duty to protect anyone much less ""ensure that felons and other prohibited persons do not possess firearms."
3	5376	9600	1	8	1	4	0	1	Strange isn't where the law abiding are disarmed by the gun control idea of wet dream laws yet there are still firearms floating about the criminal classes.	I think we recognize that gun control laws can reduce the number of criminals owning guns although not disarm every criminal.
1.333333333	8123	4469	8	9	1	3	6	1	Some people who want to ban guns try to use simplistic arguments to suggest that murder rates are tied to the number of guns available for criminal misuse; and they suggest more guns = more crime and less guns = less crime.	If gun control will not affect criminal ownership of guns and people will always be able to get a firearm if they want, why should a government make the effort to ban firearms as a precursor to atrocities?
0.333333333	9105	8328	1	6	1	121	7	1	There's not a single piece of evidence to support your claim that gun owners want the police to leave the criminals alone, or that we want gun traffickers to remain free on the streets.	Police cannot do this, and indeed do not themselves even claim to be able to do so.
3	9345	6335	18	29	1	0	1	1	I know people who want to limit ownership of guns to musket-type weapons as were used when the 2nd amendment was written and people that are for an insane amount of registration and background checks, etc.	I think the 2nd Amendment does apply to modern guns.
2	8466	7543	15	6	1	1	0	3	No it's federal law that you have to run background checks in order to keep your FFL (federal firearms license) which allows you to legally sell guns.	DC doesn't need to have an age restriction on gun ownership, because no matter what their laws say, you still have to be at least 18 to pass a federal background check to buy a gun.
1	8777	2448	27	6	1	0	12	1	Another bill that we would like to see go in the trash is the ban on manufacture of machine guns.	If we look at D.C. we can see that people who had registered their guns before the gun ban were allowed to keep their guns after the ban took effect.
2.333333333	36399	37823	24	70	3	2	3	3	How can a people defend themselves from the government, unless they are able to maintain the same weapons as the government has?	if one wants to own a gun i have no qualms with them but if they wish to own guns such as a AK47 and AK74u they should be dealt with in a more civilized manner to protect the people.
1	8543	10098	13	376	1	10	12	1	Illegal firearms can be identified and linked to other firearms and to crimes and criminals.	I do not believe OTHERS should not have guns, I think criminals and psychos who are yet to convict a gun crime should not have guns.
2	25130	28080	34	111	3	15	5	3	DC's highest gun deaths per capita coincidences with the fact that guns are legal there, doesn't mean anywhere guns are legal crime rates will be high.	However, even though there were less deaths, there was a surge in gun crime, death and non-death related, after the ban on guns.
1.333333333	9580	11028	75	212	1	13	4	1	What it seems like you are claiming is that if the owner would otherwise let you in if you didn't have a gun, you have a right to go in by the 2nd amendment.	You keep claiming that you're not of the anti-gun camp, that you actually support the Second Amendment.
4	623	546	94	121	1	27	2	1	Criminals kill people so gun haters like gun hater pilot want to pass gun control laws that only law abiding citizens obey!	Simple if the gun haters did not want your guns why do gun haters only want gun control laws that law abiding citizens obey and criminals do not?
0.666666667	8858	7602	34	66	1	22	4	1	You are asking of our government the abdication of their solemn oaths to uphold and protect The Constitution.

2.666666667	28080	7991	65	8	3	4	4	1	Keeping violent criminals in prison would do far more to reduce gun crime than banning guns.	I understand that banning guns will not stop criminals from accessing them, but it will surely drop the crime rate and make it much harder to get a gun.
1.333333333	296	975	62	21	1	5	3	1	Now that said, one has to wonder why people for gun control or anti gun types keep telling people that defend the right to bear arms that they could not win a fight.

2.666666667	9009	4400	95	26	1	9	8	1	Gun control in the U.S. does not equal crime control.	You still have to prove that gun control equals crime control and your admission that it does not is proof that it is about control and dependency on government to protect you when they have no obligation to do so.

I pointed out that the US has higher levels of gun crime than most developed nations while you tried to focus on a few tragedies in response to someone questioning the claim that criminals will always get guns.

2	8509	9507	34	40	1	8	1	1	because I've made a legitimate point that not all gun owners abide by the law?	While it may be true that more illegal acts than protective measures are associated with guns, the extension to the average law abiding gun owner's habits is invalid.

Explain exactly how the judges ruling that the Second Amendment is truly an individual right, how DC's ban on handgun ownership and their trigger lock requirements being unconstitutional, would in any way suggest that one-gun-a-month laws pass constitutional muster.
1	8543	173	221	106	1	13	54	1	We have more crime than fully armed countries not because we don't have guns.	We border two countries one of which is quite corrupt, what makes you think that criminals can't get guns.
3	8770	546	18	69	1	2	30	1	But is the answer to take down the gun free zones...and just allow kids to carry guns to school?	Innocent people were butchered where no guns were permitted, while nobody is being shot full of holes in the schools where carrying a gun is permitted.

2.333333333	4400	10229	206	10	1	3	21	1	I'd love to see how gun rationing, ammunition documentation, ending private sales, gun registration, and restriction of right to carry, has helped reduce violence crimes and make things difficult for criminals.	I do see the sense in some measures such as restricting access to guns for people who have committed violent crimes.

1.333333333	2686	12361	5	76	1	1	3	3	This should be a clear indicator that legal ownership of guns in no way has increased potential criminality for law abiding citizens.	In England, where currently the private ownership of hand guns by the law abiding is absolutely prohibited, crimes involving the use of guns are rapidly increasing: only the criminals have access to them.
1	9919	296	5	77	1	1	11	1	and who commits crimes, Criminals, so if you take guns away from law abiding citizens insuring that criminals will still be able to get weapons will have more targets to attack because people don't have any defense against criminals.

2	8008	8042	28	6	1	2	15	1	Less gun control probably means more criminals will have guns, however it also means more civilian lives will be saved.	The problem is that widespread guns means greater criminal access to guns which means greater criminal gun use which means bad things.
1.666666667	10154	296	50	65	1	1	6	1	As for the second amendment and whether gun ownership is a right or a priviledge we can discuss later.	We're talking about deadly lethal weapons that are way more powerful than what the authors of the Second Amendment had in mind.
2	9211	9987	29	40	1	1	0	1	Just to be clear, you're saying that only gun laws, somehow, are unable to deter criminal acts?	First you say no law will ever stop criminals from getting guns but now youre saying that criminals are never gun owners.
2.333333333	185	8636	25	72	1	1	18	1	Doesn't hold together, though - you have no evidence that criminal arms supply is unaffected by gun control.	You can not use this as evidence that the reduction in crime is due to the gun ban.
1	8387	6777	15	59	1	1	7	1	Gun locks are designed to keep kids from playing with guns.	Gun control should be left to the person holding the gun.

1	48	5818	27	1	1	20	5	1	Many thousands of Guns are stolen and used in GUN CREATED CRIME because most legal gun owners	"Screw ""putting more guns on the street"", how about we give gun owners more rights and more legal opportunities to use them and stop pandering to the criminals."
3	9820	10199	23	260	1	1	6	1	What you've been doing isn't a debate about gun control, it's criticism of the Supreme Court for saying the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own a gun for legal purposes.	The Second Amendment isn't a gun control law, it's an individual right, independent from militia service.
1	5376	48	2	4	1	8	2	1	I worry that the reduction of gun ownership will increase crime rates even in households with a gun.	The higher rate of gun ownership by criminals is far outweighed by the threat of citizens owning guns.
1.333333333	173	10352	106	28	1	48	3	1	So if its cause people in high crime areas want to buy guns for protection then why do they only want protection against gun murders but not other crimes.	In my view I think that complete gun control helps solve a major problem in crime and it would allow people to feel safer because they wouldn't need to have a gun to protect themselves.
2.333333333	10199	7934	93	54	1	14	3	1	Comparing the 2nd amendment to other 'rights' doesn't really apply if I am seeking to remove the second amendment.	So dont you DARE tell me that I have tried to take away anybodies second amendment rights simply because I refuse to pretend that there are rights in the constitution that simply do not exist there.
1.333333333	560	8035	6	116	1	7	1	1	Are you saying that since all guns have been banned for civilian use in Countries like England, that murders by guns and gun crimes have gone to absolute zero there?	You can debate that without guns there would be more deaths to other weapons although you can't debate it would be to the same extent as gun murders and crimes would be.
1.666666667	173	11028	78	212	1	17	4	1	What it seems like you are claiming is that if the owner would otherwise let you in if you didn't have a gun, you have a right to go in by the 2nd amendment.	So you have to read the 2nd amendment as a whole.
2.666666667	8025	10121	34	1	1	37	43	1	Students and teachers in schools need to defend themselves, too... Like laws banning guns in sensitive places, concealed carry laws are consistent with Heller�۪s self-defense rationale only because the Court claimed to limit the arms right to the home.	"School district employees should not be carrying weapons on campus, just as students should not be carrying weapons."""
1.666666667	9009	10662	110	87	1	2	4	1	"In the dicta from a maritime law case the Supreme Court commented that state laws restricting concealed weapons do not infringe upon the right to bear arms protected by the Federal Second Amendment."""	Or that the Second Amendment only keeps the federal government from passing new gun control laws?
3.333333333	4012	9841	2	34	1	28	13	1	Amendment protects the right of the states to arm their militias.	(or, for those who favor the alternative collective right view, ���the right of militia members to keep and bear their militia arms when called for by the state for militia service?�۝)
2.333333333	10145	10847	35	5	1	12	279	1	But that does not change the fact that the law has made the individual into a prohibited person, so that her gun possession is, in itself, a federal felony.	Should a drug user, a felon, be banned from possessing WEAPONS, especially guns??
2.333333333	4400	7780	15	115	1	2	5	1	Therefore, if you avoid gangs (those who tend to have guns - they are still criminals), there is little point in carrying a gun yourself.	It is not the legal gun doing the crime it is the illegaly owned guns, so if you take my guns the criminals have no one to stop them since they have guns we don't.
1	623	1543	7	92	1	2	4	1	If England wants to ban weapons, that is quite alright, but we should not trade with htem as long as they are violating the human rights of their citizens.	It is interesting how people that want to ban the right to bear arms never apply their logic to the rights they like.
1.333333333	7482	28080	18	190	1	9	3	3	It is just a case of prevention, remove guns being so easily accessible and you then decrease the gun crime and remove the need for guns to defend yourself.	Only why would you need gun registration if guns were illegal?
1	9100	9827	1	26	1	22	35	1	Plus, if all firearms are illegal, and if one were to illegally obtain a gun, why not own and use automatic weapons, just like the gangs in England are using?	Another large source of guns used in crimes are unlicensed street dealers who either get their guns through illegal transactions with licensed dealers, straw purchases, or from gun thefts.
1.666666667	907	546	4	187	1	0	14	1	I also say that when people commit a crime with a gun these people need to be punished not the law-abiding citizens!	I think what is also important is that nobody to my knowledge is saying that a law abiding citizen shouldn't have the right to own a gun.
3.666666667	4021	10133	14	16	1	3	7	1	The only law I even somewhat support is banning guns in certain areas like schools and colleges.	It involved a ban of guns within a certain proximity to schools.
0.666666667	8053	9600	40	48	1	9	8	1	Right now all the police can do is try and match bullets against other bullets in an attempt to determine which gun was used.	We measured firearm protection as an attempted or completed crime in which the victim reported using a gun to attack or threaten an offender.
1	7987	28080	49	581	1	2	6	3	it isn't guns that kill people, is the mentality these people carry around in their heads that kill other people.	If people are smoking themselves to death then that is their business, but if people are murdering each other with guns then there is more reason for government intervention.

I guess you either didnt see or chose to ignore the part about a gun on its own being no more dangerous than popsicle sticks, hence the words on its own.
1	122	9096	3	1	1	0	30	1	FACT: Because it is already illegal for convicted felons to own guns, the Fifth Amendment protects felons from being forced to incriminate themselves by registering their guns.	The bill would also protect gun manufacturers and dealers that have allowed their weapons to fall into the hands of criminals through their own negligence.
3.666666667	28080	10199	177	79	3	4	4	1	At the time the constitution was written, the militia, which was to be armed with privately owned weapons, was supposed to be our nations primary military force.	The second amendment says MILITIAS have the right to carry guns, not private citizens, and that is why the militias are there to protects us and are composed of....private citizens.
3	623	185	29	19	1	7	0	1	Gun haters will stop when the right to bear arms is banned!	But gun hater pilot will demand that the right to bear arms be limited or banned to keep criminals from getting guns.
2.333333333	4400	10011	26	173	1	8	4	1	You are pulling the same XXXX Doc did in thinking that because I don't think more guns equals less crime that I automatically must think it means MORE crime and that gun control laws are effective and needed.	Gun control in the U.S. does not equal crime control.
2.333333333	8636	8858	72	211	1	18	6	1	You say that gun control must not be effective because the study's conclusions about gun control were inconclusive.	Doesn't hold together, though - you have no evidence that criminal arms supply is unaffected by gun control.
3.333333333	764	10199	99	257	1	2	7	1	Your argument is that the Second Amendment was designed for purposes relating to the militia exclusively, and individuals being armed for matters not related to the government was never something the Founding Fathers felt necessary to protect.	Even without this preamble the second amendment would still only protect a right in connection with militia service.
1.333333333	123	4400	11	154	1	4	2	1	Muggings, burglaries, rapes, assault and battery are all examples of violent crimes that don't require a gun.	Most violent crime with guns occurs at knife fighting range.
4	4400	8858	26	201	1	8	2	1	"This is just further proof that gun control does not equal crime control and there are no ""reasonable"" nor ""responsible"" gun control laws."	Gun control in the U.S. does not equal crime control.
2.333333333	37757	1387	34	2	3	1	0	1	THe ban on these weapons is roughly equivelant to incumbent protection laws.	And it is legal to ban marijuana and cigarets but guns are protected by the constitution.
1.333333333	623	975	120	30	1	9	117	1	A person has the right to keep and bear arms for the defense of self, family, home and state, and for lawful hunting and recreational use.	********* logic is for companies and governments to deny a person the right to bears arms to defend ones self then not be held responsible when these companies and governments fail to protect the unarmed citizens!
1.666666667	38588	7482	4	7	3	4	21	1	That most people can't be trusted, so we should have more laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.	I see, so banning guns just stops law abiding citizens from having them, yet your family of criminals buys them from people who legally obtained them, or has them legally obtained for them.
2.666666667	37823	8701	93	45	3	112	1	1	"So an article that is entitled ""Gun control doesn't reduce crime, violence, say studies"" is not claiming that gun control is ineffective?"	Please tell the murder victims in these other countries that gun control works.

1.666666667	8977	10783	15	47	1	22	1	1	In some states, some guns are just not allowed and it sticks as a law.	And several states have recently passed laws allowing gun owners to carry firearms in more places ��� bars, restaurants, cars and parks.
3	969	4400	12	390	1	6	3	1	The Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States America states that, ���A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.�۝	Even if today's well-regulated militia were the National Guard, the Second Amendment still protects an individual right to keep and bear arms.

1	4813	10351	3	11	1	2	1	1	So I think gun control on the magnitude you want would effect it, how could it not?	I think a better debate would be when should gun control start?
3.333333333	17959	991	1	6	3	15	3	2	Many people who would never dream of shooting a person can own a gun simply for the artistry of a well made machine, people hunt with guns as well.	However, I can understand that people can use guns for recreation, hunting and sport.

2.333333333	1073	10351	35	11	1	3	1	1	So I think gun control on the magnitude you want would effect it, how could it not?	Although I think a gun-ban should be effective since you can�t eliminate criminality entirely, and it�s the criminals, lunatics and otherwise unbalanced people that you don�t want to have guns or have an easy time getting guns.
4	7507	970	21	13	1	3	2	2	The criminal homicides almost always include illegally gotten guns- so that's not relevant either as gun control laws won't change that.	To inact a law that makes a crime of illegal gun ownership has no effect on criminal ownership of guns.
4.333333333	25130	38588	82	5	3	8	2	3	Criminals don't care about gun bans, so a gun ban only takes guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens.	Gun laws and bans are put in place that only affect good law abiding free citizens.
1	9037	28080	100	503	1	18	5	3	If we're going to ban guns,we might as well bans knives,fireworks,and even computers.	We must be doing something right because our violent crime rates are dropping while your native country keeps rising in spite of gun and knife bans.

1	8123	10003	8	29	1	3	19	1	I really do not care particularly what gun control laws states or cities pass.	If gun control will not affect criminal ownership of guns and people will always be able to get a firearm if they want, why should a government make the effort to ban firearms as a precursor to atrocities?
1.333333333	11028	10098	212	291	1	4	6	1	"If you repealed the 2nd amendment or any ""incorporated"" amendment than that amendment would no longer be law thus not ""incorporated"" (obviously since there is nothing to incorporate)."	What it seems like you are claiming is that if the owner would otherwise let you in if you didn't have a gun, you have a right to go in by the 2nd amendment.
3	30649	38588	7	4	3	1	4	3	I see, so banning guns just stops law abiding citizens from having them, yet your family of criminals buys them from people who legally obtained them, or has them legally obtained for them.	People who follow laws, aren't causing problems with the guns they own.

3.333333333	296	28080	64	415	1	5	4	3	Something else you must keep in mind is that if we outlaw guns, the only people with guns will be outlaws, this leaves no defense for law abiding citizens.	Gun bans simple ban law abiding citizens from having guns.

2	8755	17656	178	14	1	19	12	3	Problem is ... when people continually get their state's to make laws that say only heterosexual people can marry each other, then those religions that will and want to marry gays and honor their marriages, now cannot.	If the people of one state want to call it marriage, so be it.
2	8755	10073	178	65	1	19	14	1	If so, then states need at least a rational basis for making certain marriages illegal, and there is no rational basis for making marriage between people of the same sex illegal.	If the people of one state want to call it marriage, so be it.
1.666666667	8755	1062	178	2	1	19	9	1	But saying they should have marriage is taking a sacred religious bond and making it simply a union between two people who want to have sex.	If the people of one state want to call it marriage, so be it.
2	9391	2583	328	24	1	1	4	1	If we broaden the definition of marriage to include same sex couples, wouldn't heterosexual unmarried couples still be discriminated against?	We should not argue that gays should have the 'right' to marry we should argue that the definition of ' marriage' should be changed.

I don't think we were supposed to be falling in love with the same sex and if we do feel that attraction it is easy to stop it.
1.666666667	6743	6743	14	10	1	2	9	1	It does not state in law that same-sex marriage is a civil right any more than it states you marrying you sister is a civil right.	Marriage is already a civil right everyone has--you have it too, because you can marry someone of opposite-gender right now.
2	6743	3621	14	40	1	2	1	1	The definition you'll hear from conservatives is more along the lines of: the state of being united to a person of the opposite sex as husband or wife in a consensual and contractual relationship recognized by law.	Marriage is already a civil right everyone has--you have it too, because you can marry someone of opposite-gender right now.
2.333333333	6743	10778	14	12	1	2	3	3	However this is about if it's a civil right, I don't believe any marriage is a civil right, if you truly love someone you don't need a ring and a certificate to say so.

2.333333333	6743	1879	14	12	1	2	44	1	Well guess what, if you FORCE Gays to ONLY marry those of the opposite gender it is the equivelence to an arranged marriage!	Marriage is already a civil right everyone has--you have it too, because you can marry someone of opposite-gender right now.

2	7931	47	23	541	1	4	3	2	The government has absolutely no right to tell people who they can and cannot get married to.	One of the interesting developments in recent years has been the rush by people in many states to amend their marriage statutes so that they explicitly say that marriage is between one man and one woman.
1	7858	9391	153	534	1	1	2	1	So I must ask you why exactly are you against same sex marriage when it has been shown that the ban on same sex marriage is just like the ban on interracial couples getting married?	I can only assume because you don't want to admit that perversion of marriage will rise out of same gender marriage.
1.333333333	7858	2983	153	7	1	1	8	1	I do not want to make special laws just for myself; I believe that the opponents of same-sex marriage are the ones who seek to do that.	I can only assume because you don't want to admit that perversion of marriage will rise out of same gender marriage.

2.666666667	22862	9391	23	594	3	7	7	1	Since we're talking about what rights heterosexual people have versus what rights homosexual people have, the only logical conclusion is that both groups have the same rights since marrying whomever you love is not a right.	The only way that we can fight homophobia is by showing people that homosexuals deserve the same rights as straight couples.
4.333333333	8675	8897	1	104	1	17	8	1	The federal DOMA was an effort to quarantine same-sex marriage, to exclude same-sex couples from federal rights and benefits even if states were to legalize same-sex marriage, which several have done since 1996.	The Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, was enacted by Congress in 1996 when it appeared Hawaii would soon legalize same-sex marriage and opponents worried that other states would be forced to recognize such marriages.

1.666666667	34028	2915	75	91	3	1	5	1	Furthermore, polygamous marriage has a specific set of reasons why it should not be allowed, and those reasons do not apply to same-sex marriage.

Some religions i know to be against gay marriage, but if you analyse it enough, you'll find that gay marriage isn't destroying marriage, divorce is.
1.333333333	26299	9989	1	108	3	4	13	1	No one is forcing anyone to marry someone of the same sex just because same-sex couples have the right to marry legally.	It is the same thing with the same sex marriage because a man and a man or a woman and a woman should never be together.
3	26299	1245	1	21	3	4	5	1	Who is it ok for a man and a women (both of consenting age) to fall in love, and get married, but horrible for two women (both of consenting age) to do the same?	It is the same thing with the same sex marriage because a man and a man or a woman and a woman should never be together.
3.666666667	26299	28572	1	42	3	4	4	3	God says a marriage is between a man and a woman.	It is the same thing with the same sex marriage because a man and a man or a woman and a woman should never be together.
3	26299	4295	1	1	3	4	1	2	Because it is not between a man and woman, it is not right to call this a 'marriage', in saying this, I am in no way trying to demean the relationship two people of the same gender can have.	It is the same thing with the same sex marriage because a man and a man or a woman and a woman should never be together.
4.333333333	26299	47	1	342	3	4	0	2	Gay marriage is wrong the reason is because in every definition of marriage it includes man and woman not man and man or women and women it is women and man.	It is the same thing with the same sex marriage because a man and a man or a woman and a woman should never be together.
1	2704	1613	43	1173	1	10	6	1	We don't necessarily have a right to officially recognized gay marriage, but we have every right to tell the government if we want it or not.	Gays don't call their unions marriage, we have commitment ceremonies not weddings.
2.666666667	2704	38379	43	47	1	10	5	3	If gay marriage is just called marriage, how do we express that a couple is straight married?	Gays don't call their unions marriage, we have commitment ceremonies not weddings.
3.666666667	2704	1613	43	326	1	10	11	1	"Lesbians and gays can be joined in a legal ceremony, recognized by church and state, but it doesn't have to be called a ""marriage""."	Gays don't call their unions marriage, we have commitment ceremonies not weddings.
1	2704	9391	43	304	1	10	9	1	"The reason that we ""Mormons"" opposed gay marriage so vocally is that giving gays the right to marry is that it endangers the traditional family."	Gays don't call their unions marriage, we have commitment ceremonies not weddings.
2.333333333	2704	1945	43	29	1	10	10	1	"That way we can keep the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman, and gays can still have a ""union"" with other gays."	Gays don't call their unions marriage, we have commitment ceremonies not weddings.
1.666666667	2704	29423	43	60	1	10	3	3	Allowing use will have literally no impact on people who are not gay couples looking to call their union a marriage.	Gays don't call their unions marriage, we have commitment ceremonies not weddings.
2.333333333	2704	3323	43	26	1	10	1	1	We are doing it because doing otherwise would devalue the institution in many people's eyes, much the same way as calling a gay marriage a civil union would devalue gay marriages in many people's eyes.	Gays don't call their unions marriage, we have commitment ceremonies not weddings.
1	2704	2583	43	71	1	10	0	1	"Of course, if we ended government involvement in marriage, gays would have their rights without having a ""stamp of approval."""	Gays don't call their unions marriage, we have commitment ceremonies not weddings.
1.666666667	2704	28572	43	16	1	10	0	3	Because consenting adults should have the authority to marry and be entitled to the same benefits as all heterosexual couples who perform a ceremony showing their commitment as life partners.	Gays don't call their unions marriage, we have commitment ceremonies not weddings.
1.666666667	3335	6493	27	332	2	6	32	1	To legalize same-sex marriage is a move to strengthen families, not to weaken them.	This is not going to change as same-sex marriage becomes legal in more places.
1	3335	8755	27	47	2	6	7	1	But when it comes to the other side of the coin, Gay marriage directly affects a couples ability to have their love and commitment viewed under the law and in society the same way heterosexual marriages are viewed and protected.	This is not going to change as same-sex marriage becomes legal in more places.
2	3335	3323	27	43	2	6	29	1	Those who see marriage today as a legal right would continue to see it as such.	This is not going to change as same-sex marriage becomes legal in more places.
1.333333333	3335	4532	27	16	2	6	4	2	If gay marriage were made legal, the amendment would have to prohibit incestuous marriage and polygamy at the same time.	This is not going to change as same-sex marriage becomes legal in more places.
1	3335	47	27	114	2	6	10	2	I'm curious about something from the other side of the fence...to those against same sex marriage, if a man gets a sex change and becomes a woman, should he/she be allowed to marry?	This is not going to change as same-sex marriage becomes legal in more places.
1.666666667	3621	6124	1	14	1	5	1	1	Either all people should be allowed to marry the person of their choice or no one should be allowed to marry.	If a person and a monkey are in love, they should be allowed to marry.
1	3621	1613	1	1059	1	5	7	1	What about gays who adopt should they only be allowed to get married because they adopted a child?	If a person and a monkey are in love, they should be allowed to marry.
2	3621	47	1	488	1	5	2	2	If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever why shouldn't they be allowed to get married??	If a person and a monkey are in love, they should be allowed to marry.
1	3621	6124	1	78	1	5	2	1	I think they are now advocating everyone to be allowed to get all marriage benefits even if they have no desire to be married because they are concerned about being inclusive to all.	If a person and a monkey are in love, they should be allowed to marry.
2	3621	4627	1	31	1	5	0	2	i agree with gay marriage because it is not fair to them that only man and women who are in love can only get married.	If a person and a monkey are in love, they should be allowed to marry.
1.333333333	3621	1281	1	630	1	5	1	1	Why shouldn't they be given the right to marry, people with disorders that will prevent them having children can marry, people with disorders that would seriously harm any child they have can marry.	If a person and a monkey are in love, they should be allowed to marry.
1.666666667	3621	7931	1	134	1	5	6	1	Often the argument given in favor of gay marriage is that they want the right to marry the person they love.	If a person and a monkey are in love, they should be allowed to marry.
2.333333333	3621	47	1	267	1	5	0	2	marriage is simply two people who love each other expressing that love and making a commitment, so why can't a man and a man or a woman and a woman who are in love make a commitment?	If a person and a monkey are in love, they should be allowed to marry.
3.333333333	3379	19576	75	15	1	1	37	3	Marriage is by definition between a man and a woman, and no one else, and the states interest is in a procreative type relationship, a gay couple does not entitle to these benefits.	Man-woman marriage is legal and gets state goodies, but man-man and woman-woman marriages are illegal.
1.666666667	3379	2718	75	55	1	1	2	1	And Christian doctrine teaches that marriage is the union between one man and one woman.	Man-woman marriage is legal and gets state goodies, but man-man and woman-woman marriages are illegal.
3.333333333	14482	1281	350	294	3	2	0	1	Are you saying that gay people who pay into the same systems, shouldn't also benefit?	The question is whether gay marriage should be allowed for the gays to benefit from exactly the reasons you claim you have no problem with(insurance and inheritance).
2.333333333	8834	22862	38	4	1	31	1	3	I would fight against number two because I'm for states rights do you believe each state should have the right not to recognize any marriage - for instance the states that had laws prohibiting interracial marriages?	This is me pointing out that if full faith and credit is NOT recognized in marriage, that you have a situation of legalized polygamy, just by jumping state boundaries.
3.666666667	8755	3323	47	39	1	7	1	1	Hetero and homosexual couples should have equal protection under the law.	But when it comes to the other side of the coin, Gay marriage directly affects a couples ability to have their love and commitment viewed under the law and in society the same way heterosexual marriages are viewed and protected.
4	2718	2054	33	7	1	16	3	1	Equal protection under the law means that consenting non related individuals have their relationships protected.	All citizens are protected under the law for equal treatment.
3.333333333	2718	6788	33	56	1	16	16	1	If civil unions do not provide the same benefits and protections as marriage, then civil unions are clearly not equal to marriage, and again, gay people are being treated as less-than-equal citizens.	All citizens are protected under the law for equal treatment.
2.666666667	6124	3114	64	191	1	6	5	1	Gay people aren't prevented from marrying each other, they just don't get the benefits that are given for it.	But gay people can do that too; if people are going to marry not for love but for benefits, gays can do that by marrying someone of the opposite sex just for the benefits.
1.333333333	6124	3621	64	37	1	6	4	1	Looking at the situation logically, the people who would use same-sex marriage, the people who might love someone of the same sex, are homosexuals and bisexuals.	But gay people can do that too; if people are going to marry not for love but for benefits, gays can do that by marrying someone of the opposite sex just for the benefits.
2	6124	4516	64	102	1	6	2	1	Regardless of the morality (or immorality) of gay sex and marriage, if people need benefits they need benefits.	But gay people can do that too; if people are going to marry not for love but for benefits, gays can do that by marrying someone of the opposite sex just for the benefits.
1.333333333	47	8897	438	122	2	0	5	1	I think you're getting off course here and playing semantic games--the point I was making was that people haven't said THEIR marriages will be affected by gay marriage, at least from what I've seen.	I believe that gay people have just as much of a right to be married as straight people.
1	47	788	438	117	2	0	13	1	I still think government can just but out of marriage all together.	I believe that gay people have just as much of a right to be married as straight people.

1.333333333	47	14482	438	156	2	0	6	3	gay marriage = less families only if you believe that people would choose to be gay instead of heterosexual.	I believe that gay people have just as much of a right to be married as straight people.
2.666666667	47	369	438	15	2	0	3	1	I do not think that gay people should be discriminated against, but I do feel that people should not be forced to accept a group of people whose beliefs they do not agree with.	I believe that gay people have just as much of a right to be married as straight people.
2.333333333	47	9391	438	500	2	0	7	1	As far as I know, homosexual people are not barred from marriage.	I believe that gay people have just as much of a right to be married as straight people.
1.333333333	47	5520	438	16	2	0	5	1	I think most gay people would never want to get married in a church, we want a civil marriage.	I believe that gay people have just as much of a right to be married as straight people.
2.666666667	8679	1613	20	1059	3	1	7	1	What about gays who adopt should they only be allowed to get married because they adopted a child?	By the way allowing same sex marriage does'nt automatically mean their going to have or adopt children, also Lesbians can still have children wether they are married or not
1	3323	6743	25	10	1	23	9	1	It does not state in law that same-sex marriage is a civil right any more than it states you marrying you sister is a civil right.	Also, the state legislature could pass a law which applies to both marriage and civil unions, but the governor could line-item-veto the benefits to civil unions.
1.666666667	3323	6903	25	197	1	23	7	1	Gay rights activists have continued to press for full marriage equality, saying civil unions do not satisfy a state Supreme Court ruling that entitles gay couples to the same benefits as married couples.	Also, the state legislature could pass a law which applies to both marriage and civil unions, but the governor could line-item-veto the benefits to civil unions.
2	3323	22862	25	1	1	23	14	3	The benefits aspect can be resolved simply by petitioning the government to stop using the word marriage and substitute in its place the word civil union and allow any couple (with age of consent) to join in a civil union.	Also, the state legislature could pass a law which applies to both marriage and civil unions, but the governor could line-item-veto the benefits to civil unions.
3	3323	1756	25	20	1	23	9	1	Due to the fact that legal marriages between heterosexual couples are granted federal recognition, benefits and interstate transportability which would be denied to Civil Unions if left up to individual states.	Also, the state legislature could pass a law which applies to both marriage and civil unions, but the governor could line-item-veto the benefits to civil unions.
4	3323	3621	25	103	1	23	22	1	"Any legislature could grant additional benefits to marriage with as much ease as it takes to leave off the words ""and civil unions""."	Also, the state legislature could pass a law which applies to both marriage and civil unions, but the governor could line-item-veto the benefits to civil unions.
1.333333333	9331	9619	21	22	1	13	0	1	I say the government has no place supporting secular humanists over people of faith, just so that illicit gay marriage can pass muster.	The courts didn't give people a say in overturning interracial marriage.
1.333333333	9331	6151	21	1	1	13	3	1	A RI couple said that there was nothing forbidding gays from getting married in RI, and the courts agreed.	The courts didn't give people a say in overturning interracial marriage.
1.666666667	9331	32803	21	133	1	13	6	3	The government has no say in who marries, but marriage should be used to raise a family, and children, and keep the family going.	The courts didn't give people a say in overturning interracial marriage.
1	1334	47	5	426	1	2	1	2	A married gay person is unlikely to have sex with others while he/she is married so therefore, the virus would really be kept between the couple.	Just because a homosexual may marry someone of the opposite sex does not suddenly justify keeping them from marrying a person of the opposite sex.
1.666666667	1334	6743	5	31	1	2	4	1	Gay people sometimes do get married to opposite-sex spouses, often because they are struggling with their sexual orientation and are trying, through marriage, to make themselves heterosexual.	Just because a homosexual may marry someone of the opposite sex does not suddenly justify keeping them from marrying a person of the opposite sex.
2.666666667	1334	6124	5	64	1	2	6	1	But gay people can do that too; if people are going to marry not for love but for benefits, gays can do that by marrying someone of the opposite sex just for the benefits.	Just because a homosexual may marry someone of the opposite sex does not suddenly justify keeping them from marrying a person of the opposite sex.
2	1334	6784	5	37	1	2	7	1	But concerning marriage per se it has always been a matter for society as a whole with it always being held as between people of the opposite sex.	Just because a homosexual may marry someone of the opposite sex does not suddenly justify keeping them from marrying a person of the opposite sex.
2	1334	9391	5	594	1	2	5	1	I realize that homosexuals are not attracted to members of the opposite sex and so they don't want to get married.	Just because a homosexual may marry someone of the opposite sex does not suddenly justify keeping them from marrying a person of the opposite sex.
1.333333333	1334	5811	5	63	1	2	7	1	I guess because many (not all) same-sex couples plan when they have children, they do not need the encouragement of marriage that opposite sex couples do.	Just because a homosexual may marry someone of the opposite sex does not suddenly justify keeping them from marrying a person of the opposite sex.
1	4350	10073	29	61	1	7	6	1	theres a difference to people who arent used to vast differences, especially in something like marriage, but its equal and the same to people who have been exposed to diversity within society.	Candian society is very accepting of gay people and has instituted equal marriage for same-sex couples.
1.333333333	4350	10349	29	12	1	7	7	1	Nothing would prevent straight couples from the exact same marriage whether gay people can marry or not.	Candian society is very accepting of gay people and has instituted equal marriage for same-sex couples.
1	4350	6748	29	1	1	7	0	1	It seems to me that the anti gay crowd refuses to give gay couples the same respect they expect gay people to give them.	Candian society is very accepting of gay people and has instituted equal marriage for same-sex couples.
1.333333333	4350	6493	29	289	1	7	40	1	The opponents of same-sex marriage refuse to allow gay people to be treated as equals.	Candian society is very accepting of gay people and has instituted equal marriage for same-sex couples.

1.333333333	4350	9989	29	123	1	7	38	1	Same-sex couples should have the equal right to marry legally because it benefits society to support stable families, and it especially benefits children to live in stable families with two married parents.	Candian society is very accepting of gay people and has instituted equal marriage for same-sex couples.
1	4350	10416	29	23	1	7	1	1	How people feel about polygamy has no relevance on same sex couples.	Candian society is very accepting of gay people and has instituted equal marriage for same-sex couples.
1	1613	7691	878	13	1	6	2	1	Gay marriage or not, the hospital could have and should have allowed visitation.	So what compelling reason does the government have for allowing gay marriage and NOT allowing incestuous marriages?
1.333333333	1613	34028	878	75	1	6	1	3	Well, if that's a reason to ban homosexuals from marriage, then along the same line of thought, then any couple that is infertile or chooses not to have children should not be permitted to get married.

1.333333333	1613	4627	878	15	1	6	0	2	Gay marriage is fine, but when the government says no there is no reason to rebel against the government.	So what compelling reason does the government have for allowing gay marriage and NOT allowing incestuous marriages?
3.666666667	1613	4350	878	17	1	6	4	1	concerning homosexual marriage, allowing this type of legal union also raises the question of multiple partner marriages, or marriage of siblings/close family.

1.333333333	1613	9391	878	619	1	6	9	1	"Like I said before, it doesn't matter if the law explicitly states either ""homosexuals cannot marry"" or ""homosexual marriages are not permitted"", the end result is the same: discrimination."	So what compelling reason does the government have for allowing gay marriage and NOT allowing incestuous marriages?
1.333333333	1613	11755	878	89	1	6	1	3	The constitution allows the government to define marriage between a man and a woman, but the reason for defining it that way can't be because they want to use the Christian definition.

4.333333333	1613	10073	878	74	1	6	3	1	If gay couples are allowed to marry then any combination of marriage should be allowed as long as it involves consenting adults.	So what compelling reason does the government have for allowing gay marriage and NOT allowing incestuous marriages?

You throw out this absurd claim that allowing gay marriage will allow other changes, but people reply back and show that there ARE LEGITIMATE STATE INTERESTS for preventing the other desired forms.

WMS: Thank you, yes, of course, all adult citizens should be afforded complete access to all rights, protections and benefits allowed and afforded by law, to which is attached to legally recognized marriage.
2.333333333	8897	2583	83	321	1	29	37	1	The argument in favor of same-sex marriage is based on religion often as well; whole bunches of people hold religious beliefs which state that marriage is between any two people who are not related by family.	If a church does not want to perform a same-sex marriage, the church should have the right to deny it based on religious reasons.
2.333333333	8897	14482	83	208	1	29	1	3	No one should be denied the right to marry no matter who they love and recently in the UK Quaker and Jewish churches have said that if a same sex marriage law is passed they all perform the ceremonies :)	If a church does not want to perform a same-sex marriage, the church should have the right to deny it based on religious reasons.
1.333333333	2983	2583	36	60	1	4	1	1	Well, I disagree that it discriminates against unmarried heterosexual couples; those couples still have the choice to get married to recieve the benefits of marriage or stay unmarried.	I believe that marriage is about commitment and that the government should therefore grant the benefits of marriage to every committed couple.
2.333333333	2983	1613	36	25	1	4	0	1	I think their point is that homosexual tax payers should not benefit from marriage benefits as the heterosexual community will receive more benefits if they don't include homosexual life partners in the benefits.	I believe that marriage is about commitment and that the government should therefore grant the benefits of marriage to every committed couple.
1.333333333	2983	2583	36	491	1	4	6	1	In the case of same-sex marriage, I have to assume that we are not giving benefits to people based on their religious beliefs regarding what constitutes a marriage.	I believe that marriage is about commitment and that the government should therefore grant the benefits of marriage to every committed couple.

Back to the issue (if you can), there are no significant differences between the arguement for gay marriage recognition, and say, co-habitation recognition, or polygamy marriage recognition.
1.666666667	6124	2915	124	412	1	23	42	1	Also, you said that race is an issue of acceptance of another group, but that it is possible to oppose gay marriage while fully accepting gays.	Back to the issue (if you can), there are no significant differences between the arguement for gay marriage recognition, and say, co-habitation recognition, or polygamy marriage recognition.
3.333333333	8438	1875	7	60	1	7	12	1	Marrying someone of the same sex is forbidden whether you are gay and straight, and marriage of the opposite sex is legal whether you are gay and straight.	The fact is that homosexuals have the same right to marry that straights have.
3	8438	9391	7	508	1	7	6	1	However, the issue of rights is not the same as it was with race because homosexuals are not barred from marriage with anyone heterosexuals could not also marry.	The fact is that homosexuals have the same right to marry that straights have.
1.333333333	8438	2741	7	9	1	7	1	2	"Since marriage (love) is legally sanctioned for all heterosexuals, the same rights and protection should be granted to homosexuals who choose to marry...or these ""legalities"" should be terminated completely."	The fact is that homosexuals have the same right to marry that straights have.
5	8438	7858	7	127	1	7	26	1	Especially since gays are equal in that they have the same rights to marry as straight people do.	The fact is that homosexuals have the same right to marry that straights have.
1.666666667	8438	2583	7	60	1	7	126	1	But when the government is promoting heterosexual marriage, it isn't because promoting heterosexual marriage over homosexual marriage is a good thing, and it isn't because heterosexual couples deserve more money or more benefits than same-sex couples.	The fact is that homosexuals have the same right to marry that straights have.
1.666666667	8438	3184	7	40	1	7	0	1	It is my sincere feeling that short of redifineing marriage that all gays should have the same benefits afforded married straight couples........	The fact is that homosexuals have the same right to marry that straights have.
3	8438	4339	7	70	1	7	29	1	"Now, although it is technically true that everyone is granted the right to opposite-sex marriage and no one is granted the right to same-sex marriage, this means nothing more than ""heterosexuals will use marriage, while homosexuals will not."""	The fact is that homosexuals have the same right to marry that straights have.
3	11755	2915	100	298	3	7	16	1	The fact that marriage is a civil right doesn't necessarily mean that everyone should get marriage, but certainly we are denying people civil rights if we deny them marriage.	If two people cannot do this for some legal reason, they are being denied equal rights unless marriage is completely outlawed within that nation.
3.333333333	11755	4381	100	120	3	7	2	1	And right now, as long as marriage laws deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, they are unconstitutional.	If two people cannot do this for some legal reason, they are being denied equal rights unless marriage is completely outlawed within that nation.
1.666666667	9391	2583	440	309	1	30	10	1	"If same sex ""marriage"" and not civil unions are allowed, then precedence will have been set for redefining marriage."	Changing the current state of marriage to allow same sex marriage will not effect straight marriages at all.
1.333333333	9391	3089	440	111	1	30	16	1	Even if it was certain that allowing same-sex marriage would allow these forms of marriage, that would only be a downside of legalizing same-sex marriage, it wouldn't be a reason that same-sex marriage itself is wrong.	Changing the current state of marriage to allow same sex marriage will not effect straight marriages at all.
1.666666667	9391	6646	440	182	1	30	0	1	Possibly, but changing marriage to allow such between couples of the same sex is going against the custom and usage of societies throughout the ages.	Changing the current state of marriage to allow same sex marriage will not effect straight marriages at all.
1	9391	8834	440	40	1	30	1	1	There is precidence for marriages not being recognized state to state, outside of same sex marriage.	Changing the current state of marriage to allow same sex marriage will not effect straight marriages at all.
3	9391	3621	440	143	1	30	55	1	You stated that changing same-sex marriage infringes upon people's rights because it devalues their marriage.	Changing the current state of marriage to allow same sex marriage will not effect straight marriages at all.
4	17656	17656	8	7	3	4	12	3	"By defining marriage to be only legal if ""between one man and one woman"" these groups are forcing society by law to believe and teach ONLY WHAT THEIR RELIGIONS BELIEVE and teach about marriage."	While many believe that passing laws and constitutional amendments that ban gay marriage is an act that shows how they are honoring what their religions defines as marriage.
1	17656	2583	8	57	3	4	6	1	Without legal gay marriage, gay partners don't have to worry about common law statutes being used against them by their partner.	While many believe that passing laws and constitutional amendments that ban gay marriage is an act that shows how they are honoring what their religions defines as marriage.
2.333333333	17656	6319	8	88	3	4	1	1	Their religious beliefs tell them that THEY should not be gay, or marry somebody of the same gender.

1	8897	3686	122	11	1	5	1	1	I really don't think people get married with their innitial intention of having kids, at least not as their primary purpose.	I think you're getting off course here and playing semantic games--the point I was making was that people haven't said THEIR marriages will be affected by gay marriage, at least from what I've seen.
1	8897	8171	122	72	1	5	0	1	You know, if you aren't able to grasp the concept of the inconsistency of saying one is against gay marriage when saying they are for gay rights, I don't know what else to say.

1.333333333	8897	1613	122	1173	1	5	10	1	I'm not saying that companies should add gay partners to their insurance benefits, but I am saying that people have every right to get upset about it, since the companies survive on their money.	I think you're getting off course here and playing semantic games--the point I was making was that people haven't said THEIR marriages will be affected by gay marriage, at least from what I've seen.
1.666666667	8897	10073	122	137	1	5	2	1	Accepting gay marriage/sex is accepting deviant sex/marriage...black people are not deviant...maybe you think so but I dont	I think you're getting off course here and playing semantic games--the point I was making was that people haven't said THEIR marriages will be affected by gay marriage, at least from what I've seen.

1	47	3533	454	4	2	1	0	1	When asked if gay marriage should be allowed to exist equally with marriage, but with a different name, gay rights advocates respond that this would separate it from marriage and cause discrimination.	Therefore, if the bible says gays are in the wrong, allowing gay marriage is no problem.
1.333333333	47	14482	454	389	2	1	9	3	I have no problem with gay marriage, I do have a problem with the invasion of people's rights to believe that gay union is wrong.	Therefore, if the bible says gays are in the wrong, allowing gay marriage is no problem.
2.666666667	47	14482	454	238	2	1	6	3	My problem with that statement, though, is that the bible makes references where it says that a marrige is to be strictly between only one man and one woman.	Therefore, if the bible says gays are in the wrong, allowing gay marriage is no problem.
1	47	14482	454	350	2	1	2	3	The question is whether gay marriage should be allowed for the gays to benefit from exactly the reasons you claim you have no problem with(insurance and inheritance).	Therefore, if the bible says gays are in the wrong, allowing gay marriage is no problem.
1.333333333	47	4350	454	17	2	1	4	1	concerning homosexual marriage, allowing this type of legal union also raises the question of multiple partner marriages, or marriage of siblings/close family.	Therefore, if the bible says gays are in the wrong, allowing gay marriage is no problem.
1.333333333	47	29423	454	60	2	1	3	3	Allowing use will have literally no impact on people who are not gay couples looking to call their union a marriage.	Therefore, if the bible says gays are in the wrong, allowing gay marriage is no problem.

4	47	10877	454	19	2	1	0	3	It seems that the only real argument against gay marriage is because the bible says it is wrong.	Therefore, if the bible says gays are in the wrong, allowing gay marriage is no problem.
2	1944	6743	6	10	2	7	9	1	It does not state in law that same-sex marriage is a civil right any more than it states you marrying you sister is a civil right.	The Law of the Land, allows in many States for there to be Civil Unions between people and in some instances there is the premise that Law of the Land should accept Marriage.
2.333333333	1944	3323	6	25	2	7	23	1	Also, the state legislature could pass a law which applies to both marriage and civil unions, but the governor could line-item-veto the benefits to civil unions.	The Law of the Land, allows in many States for there to be Civil Unions between people and in some instances there is the premise that Law of the Land should accept Marriage.

The Law of the Land, allows in many States for there to be Civil Unions between people and in some instances there is the premise that Law of the Land should accept Marriage.
1	1944	5889	6	1	2	7	1	1	then why does the state allow couples who can't have children to get married or couples in their 70's and 80's to get married but won't let gay people get married?	The Law of the Land, allows in many States for there to be Civil Unions between people and in some instances there is the premise that Law of the Land should accept Marriage.
2.333333333	1944	2915	6	402	2	7	48	1	Now, I am uncertain why gay people should not be allowed to have civil marriage and in fact many people (perhaps most) support civil unions.	The Law of the Land, allows in many States for there to be Civil Unions between people and in some instances there is the premise that Law of the Land should accept Marriage.
2	1944	6788	6	56	2	7	8	1	And some people, who happen to dislike gay people, should not be allowed to use the state to aim discriminatory laws against gay people.

1	6923	6743	10	31	1	1	4	1	Gay people sometimes do get married to opposite-sex spouses, often because they are struggling with their sexual orientation and are trying, through marriage, to make themselves heterosexual.	Many of those who oppose same sex marriage have forgotten that gay people still get married in their hearts and that not having a piece of paper will not stop people from feeling like they are married.
1.333333333	6923	9391	10	605	1	1	7	1	Edit: BTW gay people are being kept from their rights because same sex marriage isnt legal.	Many of those who oppose same sex marriage have forgotten that gay people still get married in their hearts and that not having a piece of paper will not stop people from feeling like they are married.
1	6923	2572	10	33	1	1	1	1	But same-sex marriage doesn't cause disease transfer; gay people will have sex whether they have marriage or not.	Many of those who oppose same sex marriage have forgotten that gay people still get married in their hearts and that not having a piece of paper will not stop people from feeling like they are married.
2	6923	9331	10	210	1	1	0	1	What you are missing is that if gay people have the right to marry then their marriage must be recognised under equal protection.	Many of those who oppose same sex marriage have forgotten that gay people still get married in their hearts and that not having a piece of paper will not stop people from feeling like they are married.
2.333333333	7931	10572	137	13	1	10	0	3	Well then I guess you're right... I guess it should be okay for gays to get married but I don't think they should have the same natural rights as a heterosexual couple.	I have never argued that marriage rights should only be extended to include same-sex couples and no other kinds of couples.
2.666666667	7931	2583	137	337	1	10	21	1	As with same-sex marriage, I believe that many of the arguments used to support gay rights can be used to support incestual marriage.	I have never argued that marriage rights should only be extended to include same-sex couples and no other kinds of couples.
1	7931	2915	137	412	1	10	11	1	It is those opposed to gay rights who don't care about the commitment; it is those opposed who say that it does not matter how commited a same-sex couple is, same-sex couples can't have marriage.	I have never argued that marriage rights should only be extended to include same-sex couples and no other kinds of couples.
2	7931	2583	137	60	1	10	119	1	In the case of same-sex marriage, I can think of no reason why we should not extend the same rights that opposite-sex couples have to same-sex couples (and plenty of reasons why we should).	I have never argued that marriage rights should only be extended to include same-sex couples and no other kinds of couples.
1.333333333	7931	9989	137	94	1	10	10	1	I argue with personal conviction, because I believe that our society as a whole will be better when same-sex couples have equal marriage rights.	I have never argued that marriage rights should only be extended to include same-sex couples and no other kinds of couples.
1	7931	4339	137	106	1	10	24	1	I have explained how denying same-sex marriage harms same-sex couples.	I have never argued that marriage rights should only be extended to include same-sex couples and no other kinds of couples.
1	7931	47	137	114	1	10	10	2	I'm curious about something from the other side of the fence...to those against same sex marriage, if a man gets a sex change and becomes a woman, should he/she be allowed to marry?	I have never argued that marriage rights should only be extended to include same-sex couples and no other kinds of couples.
1.333333333	7931	14482	137	414	1	10	5	3	Therefore as I said using traditional marriage as an argument against same-sex marriage is just like using traditional marriage as an argument against interracial marriage.	I have never argued that marriage rights should only be extended to include same-sex couples and no other kinds of couples.
3.333333333	3335	2572	63	50	2	5	14	1	If opposite-sex couples have marriage under the law, but same-sex couples do not, my religion is under attack.	If marriage was just a religious thing, then only the religious would be able to do it right?
2.666666667	3335	8228	63	53	2	5	18	1	Religious opposition to gay marriage falls under a moralistic opinion category.	If marriage was just a religious thing, then only the religious would be able to do it right?
1	3114	9391	31	534	1	2	2	1	So I must ask you why exactly are you against same sex marriage when it has been shown that the ban on same sex marriage is just like the ban on interracial couples getting married?	You don't see terrorists targetting other countries that legalized same-sex marriage, after all.
1	3114	8897	31	110	1	2	6	1	"And we do not have police looking into people's bedrooms to make sure they are having what you consider ""natural sex"" with each other in order to be considered really married."	You don't see terrorists targetting other countries that legalized same-sex marriage, after all.
1	3114	14482	31	110	1	2	3	3	If people are going to make a big deal out of two people of the same sex getting married, then people of different religions, people of no religion, even people guilty of adultery shouldn't be allowed to marry either.	You don't see terrorists targetting other countries that legalized same-sex marriage, after all.
1	3114	8834	31	40	1	2	1	1	There is precidence for marriages not being recognized state to state, outside of same sex marriage.	You don't see terrorists targetting other countries that legalized same-sex marriage, after all.
2.666666667	1944	11755	6	157	2	9	6	3	God did not introduce the concept of marriage, man did.	The Bible distinctively states that Marriage is the union of a man and a woman, and the example given is of Adam and Eve being married and joined before God, by God.

2	4627	7931	15	86	2	0	3	1	If you are going to argue that the government is being fundamentally unfair in terms of marriage, then it needs to reform marriage, not just gay marriage.	Gay marriage is fine, but when the government says no there is no reason to rebel against the government.
2.666666667	4627	1613	15	1159	2	0	4	1	"If the government can say ""gays can't marry"" today, tomorrow they could say ""Jews, Catholics, and atheists can't marry."""	Gay marriage is fine, but when the government says no there is no reason to rebel against the government.
1	6748	10073	1	78	1	0	26	1	I agree that people should have, and they do have, the religious liberty to believe whatever they want and to frown on same-sex marriage if they want to.	It seems to me that the anti gay crowd refuses to give gay couples the same respect they expect gay people to give them.
1.333333333	6748	1281	1	232	1	0	68	1	If gays deserve special treatment then I think single people should be given special priveleges to, to encourage them to create families and so they won't feel left out.	It seems to me that the anti gay crowd refuses to give gay couples the same respect they expect gay people to give them.
2	6748	3621	1	69	1	0	3	1	But I can assure you that the reason gay people fight to legalize same-sex marriage is not that they want people to recognize them, but simply because they want equal treatment under the law.	It seems to me that the anti gay crowd refuses to give gay couples the same respect they expect gay people to give them.
1.666666667	6748	7185	1	129	1	0	4	1	And I WILL point out that the issue is whether gays have the right to be treated equally with respect to marriage - not whether they are to be treated equally with respect to gay marriage.	It seems to me that the anti gay crowd refuses to give gay couples the same respect they expect gay people to give them.
1.666666667	6748	10778	1	12	1	0	0	3	I'm not gay but I believe they should be aloud to marry however if it is not in the religion for gays to we'd then they should respect that.	It seems to me that the anti gay crowd refuses to give gay couples the same respect they expect gay people to give them.
1.666666667	6748	369	1	15	1	0	3	1	I do not think that gay people should be discriminated against, but I do feel that people should not be forced to accept a group of people whose beliefs they do not agree with.

3	1613	32516	1068	15	1	14	1	3	And I never said someone should not be allowed to Mary do to their gender both men and women should be allowed to marry (each other) so it's not sexism at all really.

1.333333333	1613	4295	1068	1	1	14	1	2	Because it is not between a man and woman, it is not right to call this a 'marriage', in saying this, I am in no way trying to demean the relationship two people of the same gender can have.

1	22862	2572	4	28	3	1	0	1	I think its unfortunate that fanatics on both sides have managed to completely miss the difference between a religious sanctioned state (marriage) and equal rights under the law.	I would fight against number two because I'm for states rights do you believe each state should have the right not to recognize any marriage - for instance the states that had laws prohibiting interracial marriages?

Considering that same-sex couples very often have children, it is just as important to make them financially secure and able to raise those children as it is to do so with opposite-sex couples.
2.333333333	2583	5811	50	63	1	95	7	1	I guess because many (not all) same-sex couples plan when they have children, they do not need the encouragement of marriage that opposite sex couples do.

2	7537	6923	29	3	1	1	2	1	If gay people never formed families themselves, and never had children to look after, one could make an argument that gay marriage was an unnecessary concept.	Placing children with gay couples is unnecessary and harmful - if group homes are the only alternative then it is argued such environments are more healthy and indeed normal than farming kids out to gays
3	7858	3114	145	1	1	7	1	1	The majority of americans dont want Gay marriage... Its obvious because not one state that has let the people actually vote on this issue has legallized it.

3.333333333	2915	2583	61	337	1	5	12	1	Let me re-explain myself: If we legalize same-sex marriage, everyone will have an equal right to bestow their marriage benefits on one other person that they fall in love with.	In the case of same-sex marriage, homosexuals are completely denied equality, for they are not even allowed the same marriage benefits that others recieve without changing their sexuality.

2.666666667	2583	2915	337	91	1	21	4	1	However, some arguments in support of same-sex marriage have nothing to do with polygamous marriage.	As with same-sex marriage, I believe that many of the arguments used to support gay rights can be used to support incestual marriage.

2	2583	3089	348	111	1	9	17	1	Remember that people who are not straight currently get married just for the benefits, and people who do not love each other currently get married just for the benefits.	The fact that it is impractical to offer the benefits of marriage across many people is really far more important than the inequality, since the inequality would only be helping some families while hurting no others.

1.333333333	6646	8912	213	8	1	11	4	1	And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married.

2.333333333	8755	5811	203	198	1	85	3	1	The point of the matter was that a reasonable person could believe that gay marriage would not benefit children and thus since benefiting children is a state interest the law is ok.	Having the government recognize gay marriage over the will of the people influences people's children into thinking gay marriage is acceptable.

Unless you change the legal definition of marriage, you can't allow two men to get married to each other.
2.666666667	9391	11106	522	45	1	1	7	3	There is nothing in the constitution that gives you the right to marry whomever you like, and so current law defining marriage does not violate any existing constitutional law.

Kronus is right the people, who don't like same sex marriage, want to deny samesex couples marriage, even though there is nothing in the law, or constitution that says same sex couples can't be married.
1	5061	47	10	408	1	2	3	2	and i think i can safely say that most same sex couples looking to be married just want to be seen equal in the eyes of the law, and not so much in the eyes of your god.	Kronus is right the people, who don't like same sex marriage, want to deny samesex couples marriage, even though there is nothing in the law, or constitution that says same sex couples can't be married.
1.333333333	5061	2915	10	238	1	2	6	1	We both know that as long as marriage is kept for opposite-sex couples alone, then opposite-sex couples will be elevated above same-sex couples under the law.

2	11755	19576	89	15	3	1	37	3	Marriage is by definition between a man and a woman, and no one else, and the states interest is in a procreative type relationship, a gay couple does not entitle to these benefits.	The constitution allows the government to define marriage between a man and a woman, but the reason for defining it that way can't be because they want to use the Christian definition.
2	11755	5964	89	33	3	1	6	1	It wasn't seeking to redefine what marriage is, it was about applying marriage (as it already was--between a man and a woman) to inter-racial couples.

1	14482	9391	414	547	3	5	5	1	Ok so if you dont have to have the ability to have children to get married then why are you using that as an argument against same sex marriage?	Therefore as I said using traditional marriage as an argument against same-sex marriage is just like using traditional marriage as an argument against interracial marriage.
2	14482	2572	414	27	3	5	1	1	I think absolutely no reasonable argument can be made suggesting that same-sex marriage might cause any harm, and I think that no reasonable argument can be made which suggests that same-sex marriage will not help people.

2.333333333	9391	2915	304	10	1	35	1	1	Marriage outta government insures gays can't marry (unless the church break the Bible) because marriage is really a religious thing.	I am for gay marriage, but can't see a way for it to happen until safeguards are put in place protecting traditional families and any religions that feel that gender is an eternal and spiritual thing.
2	1281	31602	109	12	1	12	0	3	On a personal level I don't care if homosexuals get married or not but I disagree with the idea that the state and federal government don't have a right to define marriage terms.	Please give me one concrete example of how homosexual marriage destroys the integrity of marriage, as defined by the state, and as it is implemented/used by the state.
1	2915	2704	23	34	1	5	2	1	One one hand you seem to think that gay people don't have the right to get married at all--they do because you can get married anytime you want.	"If you think people are up-in-arms about gay marriage now, how up-in-arms will they be when someone suggests that the term ""marriage"" should be removed from the law?"

1.333333333	2915	10877	23	19	1	5	20	3	By denying homosexuals the right to marry you are creating a second class of people; you are discriminating against them by saying that they are not worthy of long-term, legally recognised relationships, yet heterosexuals are.	"If you think people are up-in-arms about gay marriage now, how up-in-arms will they be when someone suggests that the term ""marriage"" should be removed from the law?"
1.666666667	2915	2704	23	34	1	5	8	1	By reducing marriage to only a legal agreement, you've not only denigrated the marriages of many people, but many gay people as well who claim to have a marriage even though they don't have a license.

Same-sex couples should have the equal right to marry legally because it benefits society to support stable families, and it especially benefits children to live in stable families with two married parents.
2.333333333	9989	6743	123	39	1	38	34	1	Many social conservatives argue that benefits are provided to married couples because, in turn, married couples benefit society.	Same-sex couples should have the equal right to marry legally because it benefits society to support stable families, and it especially benefits children to live in stable families with two married parents.
3	9989	9989	123	123	1	38	39	1	Since same-sex couples are raising children, the children in these families deserve the right to have two parents who are legally married to each other.

1	4350	2583	84	405	1	5	16	1	We have to agree to disagree if a new gay marriage law is a personal right, or if it is a public decision.	Well, if we decide to make incest not taboo, we will have a different discussion, one that doesn't have a bearing on gay marriage or inter-racial marriage.
1.666666667	2583	2583	24	60	1	4	119	1	In the case of same-sex marriage, I can think of no reason why we should not extend the same rights that opposite-sex couples have to same-sex couples (and plenty of reasons why we should).	If we broaden the definition of marriage to include same sex couples, wouldn't heterosexual unmarried couples still be discriminated against?
2.333333333	6293	4699	7	11	1	15	1	1	Moral belief may have been used to justify opposition on civil rights and women's rights, but I don't think gay lobbyists realize how much moral belief IS the basis for opposing gay marriage.	Fear and anger are the tools of those who oppose gay marriage, I've never seen any public argument that could rationally explain why denying rights to a group of people was the correct and necessary thing to do.

I think their point is that homosexual tax payers should not benefit from marriage benefits as the heterosexual community will receive more benefits if they don't include homosexual life partners in the benefits.
1.666666667	1613	2583	25	60	1	0	1	1	Well, I disagree that it discriminates against unmarried heterosexual couples; those couples still have the choice to get married to recieve the benefits of marriage or stay unmarried.

"Why someone would alter the whole definition killing millions of religous definitions to say ""we have a marriage"" when homosexuals can just have there ""civil union""?"
2.333333333	2915	9391	298	622	1	1	18	1	You cannot show that discrimination prevents the exercising of rights that homosexual people have because no one has the rights you claim are being withheld.	"To claim that homosexuals have equal rights is to decieve yourself; marriage has a set of restrictions that precisely say, ""If you want to be married, you've got to stop being homosexual."""
1.333333333	3089	16568	75	9	1	3	3	3	We are not longer primitive, so we should allow any couple to marry, as we already allow with straight couples who do not have children.

3	2433	11755	16	89	1	2	1	3	The constitution allows the government to define marriage between a man and a woman, but the reason for defining it that way can't be because they want to use the Christian definition.	Remember, part of what defines marriage is that it is between a man and woman.

"And that debate also settled on ""No, BEING gay isn't wrong"", thus the act of gay marriage for gay people should also be considered a net win for society, and in no occurrences a wrong thing."

1.333333333	1281	3114	630	191	1	1	5	1	Gay people aren't prevented from marrying each other, they just don't get the benefits that are given for it.	Why shouldn't they be given the right to marry, people with disorders that will prevent them having children can marry, people with disorders that would seriously harm any child they have can marry.
2.666666667	1281	1613	630	1059	1	1	7	1	What about gays who adopt should they only be allowed to get married because they adopted a child?	Why shouldn't they be given the right to marry, people with disorders that will prevent them having children can marry, people with disorders that would seriously harm any child they have can marry.
1.333333333	1281	6124	630	61	1	1	2	1	If you think the benefits given to married people are innapropriate or unjust, that is a different topic than denying people the right to marry the person they choose.	Why shouldn't they be given the right to marry, people with disorders that will prevent them having children can marry, people with disorders that would seriously harm any child they have can marry.
1.333333333	1281	2572	630	33	1	1	1	1	But same-sex marriage doesn't cause disease transfer; gay people will have sex whether they have marriage or not.

2	2583	2583	491	60	1	6	119	1	In the case of same-sex marriage, I can think of no reason why we should not extend the same rights that opposite-sex couples have to same-sex couples (and plenty of reasons why we should).	In the case of same-sex marriage, I have to assume that we are not giving benefits to people based on their religious beliefs regarding what constitutes a marriage.
1.666666667	47	8919	110	27	2	10	1	1	You can not make the argument that gay people shouldn't be allowed to marry because of they can not breed with each other and not also make the argument that 70 year olds can not marry.	Given your statistical argument in defense of marriage, you should have some formula that should show the break-even point at which homosexual reproductive proclivities will allow them equal access to existing marriage laws.
2	490	8171	1	72	1	57	0	1	You know, if you aren't able to grasp the concept of the inconsistency of saying one is against gay marriage when saying they are for gay rights, I don't know what else to say.	I often question how many gay rights activists are actually gay, since most of the gay people I know adamantly disagree with the agenda being promoted by those who claim to represent them.
1.333333333	9391	2915	534	238	1	8	6	1	We both know that as long as marriage is kept for opposite-sex couples alone, then opposite-sex couples will be elevated above same-sex couples under the law.

3	9391	9391	534	473	1	8	3	1	We should allow same sex marriage because we as a country believe in equality for all people.	But really the only thing we have to know on the issue of same sex marriage is the Supreme Court believes marriage is a right and right now gay couples do not have that right.

2	1062	5811	5	198	1	0	3	1	The point of the matter was that a reasonable person could believe that gay marriage would not benefit children and thus since benefiting children is a state interest the law is ok.	So, if having children isn't a requirement fro marriage, then gays should be OK, right?
1.666666667	10877	6784	17	37	3	2	7	1	But concerning marriage per se it has always been a matter for society as a whole with it always being held as between people of the opposite sex.	Marriage is about the people getting married, strangers not approving in a marriage should not even be a factor to be considered.
1.333333333	10877	8755	17	203	3	2	85	1	Having the government recognize gay marriage over the will of the people influences people's children into thinking gay marriage is acceptable.

2.666666667	1062	3335	2	63	1	9	5	2	If marriage was just a religious thing, then only the religious would be able to do it right?	But saying they should have marriage is taking a sacred religious bond and making it simply a union between two people who want to have sex.
1.666666667	2583	17656	57	19	1	6	2	3	People getting together and just doing their own contracts does not get the government out of marriage because contracts are only legal if they are upheld by the law.	Without legal gay marriage, gay partners don't have to worry about common law statutes being used against them by their partner.
1.666666667	8621	6743	5	31	1	3	4	1	Gay people sometimes do get married to opposite-sex spouses, often because they are struggling with their sexual orientation and are trying, through marriage, to make themselves heterosexual.	The fact is that people are not prohibited from being married because of their sexual orientation.
2.333333333	8621	9391	5	605	1	3	7	1	Edit: BTW gay people are being kept from their rights because same sex marriage isnt legal.	The fact is that people are not prohibited from being married because of their sexual orientation.

The fact is that people are not prohibited from being married because of their sexual orientation.
1.333333333	5474	2704	111	16	1	8	5	1	Gays can never marry homosexual people, and it's not morally right to force them to only marry heterosexuals, because it's not biologically or mentally sound, and the former does no harm to anyone.	"When reloigious people disapprove of gays, it's not the ""being gay"" they are disapproving of."
2.666666667	2572	3621	50	65	1	5	28	1	I can further explain that since you cannot prove same-sex couples are inferior, you are not justified in denying them marriage.	The burden of proof is not necessarily on you to show why homosexuality is harmful but to show why denying same-sex marriage is helpful.
3	2572	2968	50	53	1	5	1	1	It is enough to show that legalizing same-sex marriage is not harmful to indicate that it should be allowed.	The burden of proof is not necessarily on you to show why homosexuality is harmful but to show why denying same-sex marriage is helpful.

1.666666667	2377	9391	4	270	1	18	4	1	People secure in their heterosexual identity or way of life, have nothing to concern themselves with if gays are being accepted.	The problem is that gay activists refuse to accept and consider the concerns of many people and the fact that these people are essentially being asked to suddenly turn their back on deeply held time honored beliefs.
2.666666667	8905	9989	2	108	1	2	13	1	No one is forcing anyone to marry someone of the same sex just because same-sex couples have the right to marry legally.	The movement for equal marriage rights is NOT a movement to try to force churches to marry same-sex couples.

2.333333333	2583	2583	337	337	1	13	12	1	Let me re-explain myself: If we legalize same-sex marriage, everyone will have an equal right to bestow their marriage benefits on one other person that they fall in love with.	If we legalize polygamy, those in polygamous relationships will be able to bestow their marriage benefits on an unlimited number of people while those in monogamous relationships will only be allowed to bestow those benefits on a single person.
