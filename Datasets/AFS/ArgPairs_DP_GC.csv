2.333333333,8891,9463,2,12,1,14,2,1,"If this is the case, then gun laws have a provable effect on how 'armed' criminals are - more gun control = less gun-carrying criminals, fact.","Private citizens can never hope to acquire firearms when gun control laws exist, but all 'criminals' have instant connections to black-market arms dealers."

2.333333333,173,28080,106,443,1,48,0,3,Making guns illegal wouldn't solve anything except to take them away from people that want to defend themselves.,In my view I think that complete gun control helps solve a major problem in crime and it would allow people to feel safer because they wouldn't need to have a gun to protect themselves.

3.333333333,8701,8858,45,211,1,1,6,1,You say that gun control must not be effective because the study's conclusions about gun control were inconclusive.,"So an article that is entitled ""Gun control doesn't reduce crime, violence, say studies"" is not claiming that gun control is ineffective?"
1.333333333,28080,10352,443,28,3,0,3,1,So if its cause people in high crime areas want to buy guns for protection then why do they only want protection against gun murders but not other crimes.,Making guns illegal wouldn't solve anything except to take them away from people that want to defend themselves.

1.333333333,28080,9919,415,3,3,4,1,1,The only way to prevent guns from falling in the hands of criminals is by law abiding people buying every gun that is manufactured and thus leaving no guns available for criminals to buy.,"Something else you must keep in mind is that if we outlaw guns, the only people with guns will be outlaws, this leaves no defense for law abiding citizens."
3.666666667,1073,28080,35,190,1,3,3,3,"It is just a case of prevention, remove guns being so easily accessible and you then decrease the gun crime and remove the need for guns to defend yourself.","Although I think a gun-ban should be effective since you can�t eliminate criminality entirely, and it�s the criminals, lunatics and otherwise unbalanced people that you don�t want to have guns or have an easy time getting guns."

3.333333333,764,1103,140,25,1,21,0,1,This is just as unrealistic a view that saying gun laws will prevent all crime- of course some criminals will not obey the law- that is what makes them criminals!,Why do people that want what they call reasonable limits on the right to bear arms believe criminals will obey a law stating criminals cannot have guns?
3.333333333,8891,7543,2,30,1,14,0,3,It's pointless people with criminal backgrounds aren't buying guns from gun stores (all of which already run background checks) there are no background checks on the black market and laws won't change that.,"Private citizens can never hope to acquire firearms when gun control laws exist, but all 'criminals' have instant connections to black-market arms dealers."
1,8284,173,44,106,1,3,54,1,We have more crime than fully armed countries not because we don't have guns.,"I could easily point out how many people are killed by criminals because they aren't armed and able to fight back, and that could be seen as grounds for removing the restrictive gun laws we have in this country."
1.666666667,185,28080,26,248,1,8,24,3,there are too many gun deaths and while there will never be a ban in America i find it appalling that so many fight to prevent gun restrictions and background checks.,If gun bans worked there would be no gun deaths in the countries that have banned guns.
3,4469,9601,9,14,1,6,6,1,All that does is imply that crime rate depends on more than just the presence/absence of guns - it disproves 'more guns = more crime' about as much as it disproves 'more guns = less crime'.,Some people who want to ban guns try to use simplistic arguments to suggest that murder rates are tied to the number of guns available for criminal misuse; and they suggest more guns = more crime and less guns = less crime.
