Bossier Parish School Board ( 3-0 , 2001 ) , the US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a school board \\'s right to implement a mandatory uniform policy , stating that requiring uniforms for the purpose of increasing test scores and improving discipline \" is in no way related to the suppression of student speech .',\n",
       " 3274: 'If school uniforms promoted educative behavior , as powerfully as conjectured , the incidents of safety infractions should have declined dramatically subsequent to the establishment of uniform policies at elementary schools in Miami-Dade County .',\n",
       " 4124: 'A 2010 peer-reviewed study found that schools with uniform policies had 12 % fewer firearm-related incidents and 15 % fewer drug-related incidents than schools without uniforms .',\n",
       " 3275: \"Ms J Brown , a head of faculty in an Essex secondary school believes ' The uniform serves as an ever-present visual reminder to the pupils of the rules we have in our school . '\",\n",
       " 4125: 'The wearing of school uniforms may give students the impression that conformity is the way to prevent conflict , and this is not an appropriate message for schools to send .',\n",
       " 4126: 'The ideology of school uniform is that it will create a safer environment for students and help with equality .',\n",
       " 3277: 'Parents want their kids to be well mannered and behaved ; a 1994 study proves that students wearing uniform at school are well perceived by teachers .',\n",
       " 4127: 'If safety really was an important issue , then why are teachers , maintenance staff and visiting parents not required to similarly wear the school uniform ?',\n",
       " 3280: 'Teachers may argue that school uniforms set a clear standard of what the students are to wear , but school uniforms may just as well get dirty as any other clothes and school uniforms may just as well tear apart after a fight or a fall .',\n",
       " 4130: 'Make uniforms an integral part of the school safety program .',\n",
       " 4132: 'Researchers in this study suggested that \" instead of directly affecting specific outcomes , uniforms act as a catalyst for change and provide a highly visible opportunity for additional programs \" within schools .',\n",
       " 3287: \"From a practical perspective , if a simple change in attire can positively influence over 30 percent , or even 25 percent , of a school 's student population , then perhaps administrators , teachers , students and community members interested in implementing a school uniform policy might believe it is worth the effort .\",\n",
       " 3288: 'Though this is an expense at the beginning , there are only small expenses that need to be made as the school year progresses On the other hand , many parents argue that uniforms are not economical as they must purchase both a school wardrobe and a casual wardrobe as children do not want or may not be permitted to wear their uniform clothes outside of school .',\n",
       " 3289: 'Schools that include , among other initiatives , see-through plastic or mesh book bags , metal detectors , aggressive truancy-reduction initiatives , drug-prevention efforts , student and/or athlete drug testing , community efforts to limit gangs , a zero-tolerance policy for weapons , character education classes , and conflict resolution proposals -- plus the uniform initiative -- frequently do improve school discipline and safety .',\n",
       " 4141: 'Another safety argument is that school children could be more easily identified while on excursions .',\n",
       " 3296: 'While requiring public school students to wear uniforms may sound like an attractive quick fix to some , actual implementation of these highly restrictive policies is often rife with difficulties .',\n",
       " 3299: 'The Benefits of Public School Uniforms : Safer Learning Environment Many school administrators and parents believe that uniforms create a better learning environment at school .',\n",
       " 3301: 'School can be boring at times – so why require students to wear uniforms that are just as ( if not more than ) boring ?',\n",
       " 3302: 'In addition , with the visual uniformity present across all students , the instance of school pride has increased .',\n",
       " 4153: \"A 2013 survey by the National Association of Elementary School Principals ( NAESP ) and uniform manufacturer Lands ' End found that a majority of school leaders believe their school uniform or formal dress code policies have had a positive impact on classroom discipline ( 85 % ) , the school 's image in the community ( 83 % ) , student safety ( 79 % ) , school pride ( 77 % ) , and student achievement ( 64 % ) .\",\n",
       " 3304: 'Draa ’s study concluded that those schools with uniform policies improved in attendance , graduation and suspension rates .',\n",
       " 4155: 'A 2010 study by researchers at the University of Houston found that the average absence rate for girls in middle and high school decreased by 7 % after the introduction of uniforms .',\n",
       " 3306: 'Public schools can still have dress codes without resorting to mandatory uniforms .',\n",
       " 3309: 'Note also that universities rarely demand students to wear uniforms , yet few seem to be worried that this will make the students unemployable .',\n",
       " 3312: 'Take the case of the Harford County Public School students , wherein 87.9 % are in strong disfavor of the mandatory uniform system .',\n",
       " 3313: 'In response , the Littlefields filed a lawsuit against the school district , under the pretenses that this uniform mandate infringed on their rights as parents to control how they brought up their children and their education .',\n",
       " 4163: 'According to another parents \\' rights group , Asserting Parental Rights — It \\'s Our Duty , mandatory uniform \" policies trample parents \\' right to raise children without government interference . \"',\n",
       " 3314: 'In addition , students can wear attire that can lead to a bad impression to school if they are outside the school campus .',\n",
       " 4164: 'According to a recent study carried out on schools , trends at schools and students concluded that more than half of the high school students openly admit their active participation in so called “ school gangs ” The research also found out that steep decline in the percentage of crimes on campus has been observed after the formal introduction of uniform policy at school .',\n",
       " 4167: 'Although uniforms have been a mainstay of private schools , public schools did n’t jump on the bandwagon until 1994 , when the Long Beach California School District integrated school uniforms to address safety issues challenging the district .',\n",
       " 3319: 'Educators in the Long Beach Unified School District have speculated that the sharp reduction in crime following the introduction of school uniforms was a result of gang conflicts being curbed .',\n",
       " 4169: 'According to proponents of these policies , uniforms improve school attitude and spirit which brings about a net decrease in truancy and absenteeism .',\n",
       " 3322: '[ Students ] remain free to wear what they want after school hours .',\n",
       " 3323: 'Many school districts that have implemented school uniforms have provided some sort of financial assistance for families that can not afford the extra expense .',\n",
       " 4173: 'A national 2013 survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94 % of those surveyed believe \" one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel , \" and 77 % estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $ 150 or less .',\n",
       " 3325: 'Some experts believe the cost is a negative aspect of school uniforms because there is no use for them outside of school .',\n",
       " 4175: 'Some experts believe that it increases the amount of clothing parents will have to buy for their children because the children will still want and need clothing for the hours they are not in school .',\n",
       " 3326: 'Some experts believe that , more than in any other area , school uniforms improve the social outcomes in a school environment .',\n",
       " 4177: 'A 2012 peer-reviewed study by researchers at the University of Nevada at Reno found that 90 % of seventh and eighth grade public school students did not like wearing uniforms .',\n",
       " 3329: 'These statistics offered by Long Beach are often most cited as a proven deterrent to school violence , after adopting a mandatory uniform policy in 1994 .',\n",
       " 3330: \"Uniforms may have a detrimental effect on students ' self-image .\",\n",
       " 3332: 'They can give the school a bad name : If the children of a school are out causing trouble wearing the uniform from a school , it can reflect badly on that school and result in fewer parents wanting to send their children there .',\n",
