1791	Hydrogen fuel cells	A safe and efficient process with low emissions particularly of methane is essential for the sustainability.	(If we did, subsidies for the fossil fuel industry wouldn't be 12 times greater than subsidies for renewable energy .)	NS
1792	Hydrogen fuel cells	Hydrogen offers the benefits of battery-electric vehicles - namely zero tailpipe emissions - without the drawbacks of short range and long recharge times.	"""Right now there are fuel cells that provide distributed generation to schools, grocery stores, data centers, anywhere that has requirements for highly dependable, on-site generation."""	NS
1793	Hydrogen fuel cells	* Creating affordable hydrogen fuel cells : Fuel cells are now ten times more expensive than internal combustion engines.	Therefore, a fuel cell electric vehicle is potentially 3 times as efficient as traditional combustion vehicle and virtually pollution-free.	NS
1794	Hydrogen fuel cells	These kits can also be expensive, costing as much as $4,000 to convert the engine.	The less moving, the less friction that is produced, and it is friction that tends to damage vehicles and require maintenance.	NS
1795	Hydrogen fuel cells	Using hydrogen instead of burning fossil fuels makes our air cleaner, diversifies our energy supply and potentially reduces global warming.	The fuel cell may be operated to generate the additional hydrogen when the cost of electricity and/or fuel makes such generation economically favorable.	NS
