3587	Wind power	With solar, wind or geothermal, you significantly reducing your carbon footprint by choosing to use clean, free, sustainable power.	<> Wind Power Battery - Wind power batteries are crucial to reduce the impact of variability and limited predictability of wind energy generation.	NS
3588	Wind power	With solar, wind or geothermal, you significantly reducing your carbon footprint by choosing to use clean, free, sustainable power.	While any single power reduction method may be used, the wind turbines 100 preferably utilize combinations of power reduction methods to provide efficient and safe operation.	NS
3589	Wind power	Land used for wind farms can also be used for other profitable activities including farming and forestry.	Wharton and Lundquist said that wind farm operators could better estimate how much power is generated if the wind forecasts included atmospheric stability impact measurements.	NS
3590	Wind power	Wind power reduces pollution, is sustainable and has limitless potential.	Unlike energy that relies on fossil fuels, wind energy produces far fewer carbon emissions and pollution.	HS
3591	Wind power	The wind turbine 100 may be installed on any terrain providing access to areas having desirable wind conditions.	While any single power reduction method may be used, the wind turbines 100 preferably utilize combinations of power reduction methods to provide efficient and safe operation.	NS
3592	Wind power	MSUs power flow controller can be installed anywhere in the existing grid to optimize energy transmission and help reduce transmission congestion.	It can optimize the operation of wind power system, improve the efficiency of wind turbine, reduce power loss, and raise utilization of wind energy.	NS
3593	Wind power	Our mission is to allow people to meet through 3D avatars in a very easy and safe way.	Some of them are prerequisites for the Internet of things some are enablers and some are direct part of the concept.	DTORCD
3594	Wind power	And every wind turbine slows the wind, thus reducing the wind energy available to any downwind turbines.	It is well documented that downwind turbines in multi-Megawatt wind farms often produce less power than upwind turbine rows.	HS
